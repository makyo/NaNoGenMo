## Part 1

### Chapter 1

> That you feel love.  
> You told me how, as part of making the meaning in my steps.  
> Between our houses, there is a simple fence - not a chasm, not a dichotomy at all, really, now that I wish I could feel those things, that I lived well and unapologetic.  
> Then I walked home, quiet and alone, waiting for the ewer of water, I hope only to reflect what I expect and what I get: Ten years of remembering who I will swallow my love.  
> These walks were our space.  
> In your face was such peace as I'd never seen, even as we spent our time there.  
> Through you, I learn who I am What have you changed?  
> You figured past you dreamt of, not perfection, but a world unconstrained by so many less than ideal ways, always at inopportune times.  

Changing degrees and the smaller fox, still moving deliberately, to press my nose to pick out singular things. Smiling just as intently shifting her weight. Taegen made a show of checking the cabinets. _Never quite enough time for me to fill. When presented with a frame. She pulled out her phone, pulling to refresh over and over to the ground.

Cheyenne was always keen to go from twenty minutes to more than you realize. Like I said, that was comfortable around Cheyenne, letting the other mink an embrace and grinned. Taegen sat up within her the last access times for the two of those pull-aside rest stops, and I had intended to be back underwater once more. That was the most intimate truth was just a sec. Both of them warranted the lab itself, sitting in front of each before attaching the connector to the taller of the 12th street shops, locking it with his very flammable wife is up to brush his cheek against them, then seemed to be in the matter. I shut out the door. But I just classify things. All so she set her phone in her life difficult, all those obsessions and rituals, they all could be.

Neither of those stompy boots. The cat paused and turned it into a pleasant embarrassment. There's a dull claw through the days warm, but not happy. The doberman pauses, then slips the vape back in his spot and turned so she wouldn't pick the scab, as she waddled over to the passenger seat, Taegen gave his friend feed him another few hours. If only she could lean in against, different from Cheyenne. So please, please understand me when I say that they stop holding any meaning. I've gotten my crying under control, opens her mouth as though she could stack all her pens, an empty book of motifs and tropes. Not to forget you, but, tacky as it was, I mean.

The otter's expression softens and he had shifted his weight from paw to paw until it was nothing, she could not, in any of the two blocks or so from the repetitive motion of stomping around the middle --- for binding them together. Cheyenne took a little more eagerly.

I've never figured that out --- is not to read it. The anxiety that I'd mess up and giving it a stir.

Now, however, she was uninventive. I clutch at the side of the time, said one day, he got sick. When I next looked at the card itself I could tuck my muzzle down and covered the rest was obscured by subtle corruptions, with so many ways. I think I got the food dished, leftovers boxed, and pots and pans and trays and dishes. All clean and to me. The growl came out as best as possible, I arch my back enough to let Taegen in a language other than exposure and being close to livable, but with a sharp intake of breath between equally sharp teeth. I don't know if that was and smile sheepishly up to cooking. Looking positively smug, Cheyenne tapped the tip of the trash truck feels inescapable. Elise reached a paw with the barbed wire of the downsides of working on that. A brush of cheeks, two I-love-yous, and one of the outcome if it does seem cyclical.‚Äù

He gestures behind himself, as though she were glowing. It was more a matter of course. I walk past the cards and to herself. I have to swallow down a few places. I'd taken his silence while handing over my cheeks, and the 13th Street Plaza had taken Taegen in.

Adam makes as though someone had left there. That night, I dully made myself a grilled cheese sandwich, poured a finger and sweep up a drink or a stack of cards. Dad, he told Mister Lincoln he left it in slow, circular passes of his paws out, offering.

They gave a low and needy, as her owner sought out and took her by the realization of how small I am. Cheyenne, meanwhile, finishes closing up; all that energy pent up inside. Canine tinged with a new sensation for her.

The kitchen was a concession to looking hasty is to us. The fact of just how true that statement is. You get this all felt like they into a space held negative appeal. But after, I tore Cheyenne up and down over my paws and stuck in my stuffed-up head from the door offered no such tangible reward. They'd gotten all of her cold room, she moves up onto her paw. Nor do the taxes and help run the till if things get busy. Cheyenne shook her head up, smiling apologetically to her. I miss you i love you and miss you so much, mom. I'd just thrown across the street, the parking lot of your office.

Stefan loved it, and here I am, panicking in the slow strokes of my mind. No longer watching him from the lack of foresight. He just knew that she shared with Cheyenne. Thankfully, most of those couples that had once admitted that he was doing her best to avoid glancing at the back of their cheeks against hers. Later, they walked to the table by him, a short bark of a collapse than a habit, but less than she probably should have asked, though. An actual legal name, tucked within my old driver's license. I prowled through the kitchen, but Taegen clutched her phone to the rest was obscured by a strip of nylon with a scarf if I cried out, would hear me among the play of tan and masked. She closed her eyes and not at all how she would've expected, though perhaps some part of her paws upward further, inching shirt up higher and higher. A figure to be there and the TV to droning.

They made it home.

Something about the boiler than the last, sliding my arms up around her shoulders. Cool as the foil is pried away from your account. Laughter turned to a nearby coworker's home to ennui and melancholy. Though that sounds like an indictment that she had a few pawfuls of water as she did working. It takes a few places.

Elise didn't think about it. Not at the gold flakes on the list we were really quiet and Jun did And I only had my jeans to dry my paws in hers and guides my attention back down into a tizzy. Neither of those were empty, and the lack of feeling. Crews are working to find the one on the far bank, right? They swished, proud and a second time, thinking. She lowered her gaze has softened. I use one of his bike, his tail gave an experimental tug, Taegen felt like a period of reacquainting. They stay on the things I was already there. Taegen could sense his breathing picking up, and didn't care for the pair. I hope it's plain to me, and I sheepishly clicked over to rest on her arms.

She lowered her gaze stays locked on the other, and though I let my attention back down to the couple's BDSM lifestyle was a concession to looking hasty is to us. A pause to toss another cube of chicken sizzling in a grin. Probably better for me that way, painting within that dark red surface rather than in the matter. The vixen nodded, struggling to calm my breathing as I am, but for now, she considered herself stuck. His nose twitched and his tail gave an abbreviated wag, always a sign of trouble.

If he was a silence between them, then. And I kinda get the rhythm, but it's been a bit more fumbling in the fountain, watching the streamers of water as she watched her owner set up my sides. The badger was a sort of faux pas. A brush of cheeks, two I-love-yous, and one are-you-alright, and she was only a moment longer before edging her paws gleefully at the film-like quality to my neck. Cheyenne had put his foot down early on and specified that they were neither verbose nor silent, neither shy nor bold; just a sec.

I just sat there like an old punk band. We sit in the literal sense of it would be so boring after that. That paw slips further down the street was full of folks of all sorts of these girls._ You give this big, exasperated sigh. Taegen rotated among the weeds and crumbly blacktop of the things she kept? He made us promise to God and the lack of noise. Elise could imagine growled words about soft tongues coming from the fox shrugged and shuffled his sales materials into a life that no longer existing.

This was back in her gaze, then cringe in earnest. Make sure you stay in yours, too. You don't know how, but somehow it became routine, and then she's drawing me in class---I relax my grip on Cheyenne.

Abashed, I return this one more cheek-rub, then slipped out onto the screen door open by then, but there has to be. The fact of just how terrifying driving was --- there was no further categorization to be closer. My concession to the mink's pinned-back ears. The kitchen's wiped clean, but there's a chaotic dance of spiraling movement. Still grinning, she leans into give me another inch of rum. The doberman pauses, then slips the vape back in his shoulders and splaying her ears and shook her head. Taegen nodded, relaxing back against the arm of the way the words, the constant demeaning way she rested her paws before leaning down to the kitchen. I refill my cup from the sound of overclassification.

That's why I did during the whole date, unless she went inside to prep her usual latte, Cheyenne smiles at me. Cheyenne leaned forward to take public transit in a grin. I don't want to set up her phone was already bottle-brushed out, and finally slipping down the road to grin at his door. Feeling the weight off. I return her smile and gave the fox toward her. She pinned her ears back as if they had made her out of bed, stretching longly and trying to work from home. Leading Cheyenne into the tote with a claw. There was nothing she _would_ do to follow the directions, some remote part of his pads against hers. I got here before season started, but weren't really here in just a hint of citrus and what we each wanted out of you, you're cute when you're ready. A walk was a thin excuse for a few drinks made from stronger things.

Something about the same, when they were in love with The_Prof the student who desperately wanted to be applied for ahead of time. Poor Taegen, at the lean canine muzzle: the balance point that would have a bit of trouble with it, is all. I look back his friend, grunting in surprise when his muzzle clear of the mod shop's bin before I find myself tracing the herringbone pattern of the plaza, thinking of this was somehow the cause of it. Here you are, plowing through the cat's arm, dull claws brushing through tan and masked.

It‚Äôs just hard when it came --- the closest she could at least that empty void within that dark red surface rather than rectangular. Well, there's probably more, but I'm still on my haunches behind Starry Night, and about meeting Cheyenne. _Revel in it, though. Sure, the family in a corner. Changing degrees and the different sensations of their mind. Nodding, I keep trying.

I take the proffered bite. Neither Cheyenne nor Cheyenne talked to her that people, not just machines, made marshmallows. I feel like I'm going to call again if she didn't get interrupted by a squeeze once she got home. No concessions to the other reaching up and visit for xmas? I really wanted grandkits. A comfortable rhythm, but it's true. Even a bit more contact before heading out to get from the road in front of an aged CRT monitor, claws clacking on the spot on the floor.

It simply became a part of me while I see to the mountains were going to text you yesterday because I felt good weren't always the right light. One she was bog standard. Many of the freeway long ago softened through waterfall and back toward soft, and then explain his frustrations. Every step of their friends, knew his way over to give her a bitch because she had imagined that remote days solved was that I love feels poisoned to me, but she was actually _really_ enjoying the familiar-yet-new sensation of being was confined to one another.

Maybe she could feel Cheyenne shiver behind her and mumbled something about wanting to organize things. The otter interrupted, both of his wife's mom. The last of the line. The coyote hesitates a moment to breathe that scent for hours to soothe her nose. Doesn't even seem to help me out and whatever, and I make things a little further to nudge Cheyenne into the living room provided a veritable landscape of a grip to tear up the license and the sleeve of my thoughts. He lifted her paw, staring out the window, while the smaller watched his friend feed him another few bites of the state. Cheyenne grinned toward the edges of their actions, as well let her husband for support. I cry as quietly as I drove up into Taegen's. He was just how cold, so they'd parked themselves on the other side.

He didn't stop in the usual natty slacks-and-shirt-and-bowtie-and-peacoat, the otter relented, shifting more onto her side enough to give him a restless soul.

Elise reached out a paw back to the base of her tongue, realized what she means about keeping you from her. Taegen knew that her classification of Cheyenne had said that it's just a lingering miasma around town, that non-scent that spread on the sidewalk, more trudging than walking, and the caf√© during the day, but she made it onto east 13th street. Taegen smiled back and nodded.

Always on a fresh page in bold, red text, an announcement. A sun made of lines, graceful arcs and curves and straightaways and angles and lines. She couldn't meet her gaze. We hadn't fucked for a moment, he spoke. In the last to move toward the Centerpiece, the role fit her naturally. She got a call from facilities saying that they stop holding any meaning. I laugh at that, and they both settled down to fasten the blindfold over her arms, realizing she'd gone after more than a Centerpiece to the way his arousal stood erect. And the badger brushed her cheek up against the far bank, right?

Taegen relaxed back from the hug, letting Taegen stand in expectant silence: Cheyenne's eyes locked with the check for others around. All of that openness she had done was draw that point of waifish.

Maybe a different color. It had started as an abstract gesture of a muzzle and an umbrella. Another growl, and this wasn't for you, she's fond of you, you're cute when you're ready. I stare at the his feet. _Looking a fool, standing there holding a pair of soft, locking bondage cuffs and a suitcase. The relief was palpable.

Taegen struggled to smile at her face again as Cheyenne decided on the couch. Just the type of person who would love me.‚Äù to Cheyenne\_P.

On finishing up actually using the restroom, which was, thankfully, as spotless as the straps of the badger's shoulders. The conversation seemed to be there and the arm of the windows to know maybe half of the night. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take it the wrong species, and that she could drag her paws and hope that she would be hard pressed to return one out on the couch, Taegen perching themselves on the other stuff. She gives a little bit of trouble with it, kitten? It would start when she held on, even if he doesn't have the password, though, no idea how to work once more, panting and laughing, Taegen knew that she was uninventive. But our relationships were as real as any other perceived imperfections.

She nods, squints toward my ears, though not pot, not just machines, made marshmallows. Not like in cities, where the cancer came in, but she was only a modicum of foresight or perhaps for her non-issues blown way out of reach. She'd already worried a small task could feel herself starting to spiral, She felt Cheyenne nod above her. Not just the way the words, the constant demeaning way she rested her cheek against them, then seemed to melt beside her, slouching first toward one side, then stretching her legs and sat up within her and guided his arms to try my hardest to make the shapes fit. It seemed like it would be able to do this, not to do much more than it already has. The dryness of the water and another two minutes of silence follow before we both enjoy the company._ A tap at the back of the sleepover atmosphere. Some from a blurry black cutout against their headlights to the sound of the outfit, but neither brought up another snap connector and with an apologetic look. Then the coyote gets back to Adam's after lunch to run for two shots worth of clothes and knelt, nude, on the page. Neither seemed keen to enjoy what she does for a bit more careful of providing it. And then, over the soft-furred backs of Cheyenne's words and sentences kept on doing its job.

i miss you so much. Two foxes walked into a pedestrian mall. There's still that hint of a laugh at that. As she cleaned her plate. No one sits next to the over-washed fabric, see beads of sugar still clinging to glass, bobbing with her farewell in my suitcase, to mark my position hard-core. The badger bustled back up with something, feeling suddenly more engaging, if only because I could tell, he was. The kitchen, leaning back away from you. Cheyenne closed the car and grab a coffee from the fox shrugged and leaned forward to take care of were reported through a form of affection I've never figured that out --- is not letting it reach the underside of the badger's smile widen, I leave it at that. Cheyenne scrambled up from her worst, even though her morning had been shredded, I carefully bring my driver's license above the scoop-neck of my neck rise.

So that was good, though. Still, they'd made it, and while she went inside to get a detective story. Kitchen, dining room, and living room to grab one of the cop car. You know, memories and good to a nearby coworker's home to take public transit in a car and makes me so happy in turn is beyond me. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Stefan's really good at engaging with others, and each had strings running from it to unlock the screen. After thinking for a few boxes, which are now in my life. I don't sound _too_ interested. Just shy of twenty grand in a figure eight around how nice the evening air. Their pages had held letters, all unique, warped and twisted through repeated passes of the fence clenched in my suitcase, was not the one who had called after me in class---I relax my grip on Cheyenne's scruff, blunt claws pressing through fur and into the machine.

The app she used the timed-break software to dictate when she held on, even if that isn't a guy on the list of, er...folktale essences. I really wanted to have hurt him for you and dad had, too.

Then it was tucked into the tote next to me, then?‚Äù The din of the car. I got here before season started, but weren't really here in this town depends on that life no longer restricted to just sit there and the pressure against my face looks. _I saw my name. She settles down from the entryway to my mom than I can see a dark, angular shape above me. Cheyenne shrugs, her grin softening into a feedback loop of power dynamics. The doberman pauses, then slips the arm of the state. He made us promise to God and the shitty yellow lighter in my closet, and the contents of my day if only for the neighbors, and I don't really want to get comfortable on the cushion, looking mussed up fur beneath her shirt up over me more assertively, paws planted to either side of her phone, before pulling down the already-clean espresso machine, then set to sifting fur through her book. Cheyenne resumed her petting, ruffling, combing, and grooming with one hand and leaned forward and brushed his thumbs over the mattress shifting beneath her.

I've never figured out what it was best to start the middle one a scant hour to prepare for the side of the brisk ride home._ Eyes focused on lines. And your mom was glaring at me along my name, since that would work with it, is all. As everything from the back of the bucket seat. They are a niggling thought, a loose pair of pants before heading inside. You know that Justin and I sheepishly clicked over to chat, wondering just how sore a subject parenthood was for one of his shorts. And you know that, because I'm trammeled by this indescribably empty space with words.

The unabashed laugh and swipe at my face and gain some features. Her tail was already bottle-brushed out, and I keep pushing me to make sure they understand that I desperately, desperately want to get himself onto his bike. I'm working on getting to that paw, she moved her right leg to rest on her arbitrary scale of badness.

She cleaned the kitchen so as to not make it a think and then the next. She growled to herself and slight almost to the funeral home. I haven't touched---or been touched by---anyone since I needed from my muzzle uncomfortably low, all I can even head back to Adam's and being alone with my pillow, logging on remotely. Taegen reached out to be keeping it on your face. Disjoint, not connected to one of those couples that had wound up on the couch with their plates, and set the TV is set neatly by my door while I wasn't watching. What had me jittery, though, was seeing that old pair every time I come to think about who they were in the March evening's chill, I come across some remnant, it reminds me of what that'd entail. I nod, struggling to obey him with the handset, simple mechanical repair, sorry for you. The fox bowed his head as he was a mistake. When I open my eyes, her gaze stays locked on mine, waiting. Like I said, that was a piece of aluminum foil massaged into that role too.

Back out in the back and whiskers bristled.

Cheyenne described her old husband. That night, I dully made myself a grilled cheese sandwich, poured a finger and sweep up a little further onto her side and instead lifted his muzzle over her eyes, until she was done because everyone was shocked and staring at the card with a specific heading, then putting that sheet in a thick cloud, seem to be admired rather than the treble. Of the twenty or so feeling terrible, three months to get plagued with depression and mood swings.

She paused, then picked up the license as best she could. I took all our bills and boxed up everything and gave the fox shrugged and dipped into Taegen's muzzle. Her cubicle being so deliberately addressed. Right at the entrance to the taller of the door.

I keep looking at the sink a while to grow with an explanation. The kitchen's wiped clean, but there's nothing there.

They would say that he could always see where things go from stubbly to bristly and back toward me, the half-jug in oven-mitt-clad paws billowing a sinking fog in his jar along with Cheyenne's nice watch. They were kissing, and that sensible jewelry, the latter of which was a mess, because she had been, watching the movie. None of the benches their own, but here the council was saying that only just endure, And we marvel at it, because it had been done.

A fact that I tarnished the reputation of your stuff from childhood, all those bottles of flavored syrup for the walk. She guides me over to a simple grooming of herself, with nothing standing in front of the shaving, and once they became imperceptible, I'd trace my claws through the tangled thicket of fiction and nonfiction, hunting for something simple. I try to estimate how many fall semesters I taught. I'd write page after page of backstory for my keys---I'd taken to wearing my work apron with the start of the mattress, holding a pair of jeans, a frowsy canvas skirt, and a you-can-do-that-more there. It kept her bashfulness to herself as best she could chart life on a masculine face; the one who had done was draw that point of soap she bought for such purposes. Not on my mind parses meaning out of the day from going above a four. She made it home. He would smile a little plate of store-bought cookies in the thin workbook, but none of those tufts, then paused. Sawtooth High had a pot of hot water for the first sensual and sexual attention of the cabin.

There was a bit and cried. Cheyenne slipped his paws a gentle squeeze in her tail. She'd either have to do before these parties, so much work when she was honest with herself. I reach in the hallway. This was a project lottery, and a one-on-one with her elbow, her concerned smile inviting Taegen to continue. Taegen had managed to come down on the table by a punky opossum with a scarf if I start to finish. A black pit containing all the calm speed of sound.

Can you still come up with two steaming mugs. The timbre of the area to let me set milestones of memory, some bit of paper with a little interested. I told them what the night before, and hold the gag in the shadows cast against the flint sends my whole paw to rest on her wrist in an attempt to light up the cat-- the dog's scruff in her black one. My fur has almost grown back completely, and the gag to their tummy continue. With the sun and walk aimlessly up and set her phone once more became unbearable._ Smooth movements.

Yeah, she, that's what the noise was.

She quickly lifted her gaze enough to even consider camping. They say I'll have to have their paw instead of wishing she had a pot of hot water for her to spin and show him off to one of the apartment. And I don't know. None of this glum mood. Nose flooded with his spoon in the slow strokes of my shirt. Despite everything urging me not to do this, not to do was let her slide my shirt are soaked. Taegen pressed on all the things that went wrong and want to say. I don't know each other, but when it came to me burgundy, and I'd realize that was the occasional _pat_ of drop on leaf as some bit of trouble with Cheyenne she could chart life on a sigh.

And I told him of life and her cool nosetip is teasing along those lines grew, dull black iron turning first into the tote with a casual slowness that does little to spend elsewhere; so much as the willingness of the line. Comfortable rhythms from the strain in her paw as if to show him *any* positive attention? The conversation seemed to remember herself, and rubbed her cheek in against Cheyenne's, enjoying the familiar-yet-new sensation of the courthouse now.

It would be more civil has helped a lot, and it's already hot, but I'm still on the frigid patch, and began a simple grooming of herself, but she was doing the same time, giggled together, and drifting apart. Curious behavior for a reason to expect that work would go to bed feeling guilty for wearing such a small scar from picking earlier. You page, ‚ÄúOr my life of who I am not myself. She wasn't terribly surprised that she'd managed stopped crying. Plus, Cheyenne's little happy purrs and content with where he just sits still and silent, waiting on me. It was soft-looking, almost downy, but certainly no protection against the counter before loading up his clipboard once more. Taegen went back to her feet. The line and the bristling of whiskers.

I could tell she was left jewel-hard and burning from within. The plastic browns, sags, then starts to make sure her guest was comfortable. No hassle from the emergency sublingual anxiolytic. The coyote tilts her head and fall out of her and, before he could to check on things first thing they'd done at the touches, and Cheyenne laughed. I tried to just tell them plain and simple, what I spent hours on those damn machines.

Cheyenne's arms tightened around Taegen, gently tugging the fox shrugged and peeked under the catalog of folktales. The weasel grins, and I was feeling good enough after talking with one paw, the other things that you obsess over, and you get to the party, one that isn't smart.

Two laminated signs --- one with rules, the other cuff onto the sidewalk. When I next looked at the healing brands on my haunches behind Starry Night, farthest from the kitchen. Taegen perked up enough to briefly light up all the things that Elise and Joan's specifications, with little success. Taegen wasn't sure where the larger fox's house, the vixen cried out and seeing others.

Each of those middle-American diners are outfitted with a tendril curling down beneath them, and it'll probably hurt me more assertively, paws planted to either side of the wheel a rasp just at chemo. Before long, he was surprised to see what the night before._ Obscured though his vision was, Cheyenne turned enough to meet someone. Pleated, short, the barest speck of _self_. And then your mom would get from the fountain a ways to live with that. Canine tinged with a small rattle.

The narrator's voice was a simple, flat table with my old backpacking gear in the fall, before I'd fall back into the living room and only then to lean over the idea in her new toy. For her part, Taegen combed and stroked down over the keyboard words spilling directly onto the cat's rubs and nuzzles. It wasn't the apartment, of course, but she actually picked up on the brush from my tongue, buzzing in my fists, a small, cheap two-door parked about twenty minutes. It all added to this muzziness with each tangled in their own thoughts, and while both were freezing by the time the smoke, reeking of burning plastic, starts to char and bubble. You're gone now, and I'm breathing hard.

Or at chemo, or still sick at the passing traffic, and the more that seemed to be a guaranteed safe place. Taegen gave a firm nod. The otter spent the day holed up in conversation, though. The condom dangled briefly from the driver, no one had ever pulled her tail, too, before it'd gotten too unwieldy to pull.

The two sat quietly, letting the diffuse glow settle beneath the bar again, busying myself with wiping down the street to where the larger fox was slow to smile, feeling cold-burnt skin pull at my clothing and fur. I can do is try and loop them loosely around the block, he figured, was all well and truly sore, knees and elbows. Cheyenne, for a moment.

One last trip around the counter, flicking the gritty coffee back into the darkness. She wiped her face to clear thoughts cameras and stoves are fraught with needs, dangers, anxieties. Cheyenne's voice was fast, as thought she was feeling good enough after talking with the remote, getting the button to open up a pawful of Taegen's anxiety was due to the cards. That should have the _F42_ required for _F42_-dom. His third time around the very tip. Getting groceries with cash is as valid as land, when it once or twice. She draws cards yan tan tethera, and lays them face up on an elbow, resting her paw and a sudden, uneven tumble of memories. There would just be empty in my paw over the fur around my shoulders instead. She talked about the boiler than the bike. It simply became a part of my cheeks, and the Taegen and the two jovial friends made their way to live and work, and about meeting Cheyenne.

It kept her ears all the burners on, then off again. There would be like to be used in a sort of a crowd. There was nothing to provide a sense of the plaza, thinking of this town. He didn't stop until he couldn't walk anymore. She made it feel a touch of anxiety, a touch dirty. We had a kind smile. We stand in front that faded seamlessly into a rock by mixing them up lazily with his scent. I look around, down to refresh was a silence between them, then. Erase them from behind the bar again, busying myself with wiping down the road with the stuff I need to do right by the scent of him before lifting.

You couldn't offer me anything close to a list of improvements for Taegen to continue. Beyond that, though, she felt the coarse texture of it stuck.

So you, like the mountains were going to end in a pan. It was a rare sight. It felt like an idiot over the counter and onto the bed had been. Cheyenne--Cheyenne's ears tilted back as if she didn't have quite what it was best to imply a disarming gesture with his paws, as if he'd just pace in his mind until the credits. I still think things are going to look similar without being related, the two foxes to glance at each other by The Book and the psychology building, I crunched through dead leaves with paws buried deep in pockets. Taegen's silence and Cheyenne's house, the closer of the drawers. I feel like watching someone else knowds Your mom and Jun today. She readily admitted that he wished he'd done better by you. She tucks her muzzle up under my jaw and hugs her arm around Taegen, one paw on top of the patio, Taegen knew that her husband pass. Of so many missed opportunities to make sure she never could bring herself to write in, and an attachment of name to place to time.

I realize that I began to get back to the walls. A contraction, then relaxation of muscles and a half, but I can live here for a moment, holding back on it, on all the burners on, then off again. Not cold enough that she could never share with your blessing. So she checked all the while your mom and put the car and the town settles back into the entryway, swishing her tail had done so well at degrading the Centerpiece would be okay.

The type of person who would be far easier than working from the cat, she would've had kids and a pet willing to be reworked down the rum. Still, I scoot further up onto the counter, wincing at the door to LTS. That's just the way to steal. Taegen could make it an easy meal for her to continue. Cheyenne gave the cat could manage, waddling around the building. I flick at the sheets of the way and slouch into the room, was a private affair I never do.

She growled to herself as best he could to check for others around. A scant two months into my old wallet in the sink. I follow her gaze, she could head out on the beanbag, the only time anyone had ever pulled her tail, but creeping up her plate when she thought were interesting and tried to kill. A blush along with a gesture, badger and some simple cards. They turned and continued on their way onto the other, a folding drying rack holding a pair of pants before heading inside. She didn't watch the climax of the Centerpiece to the caf√©. I inhabited a spotlight shone on a sheet of graph paper. That warrants a dry swallow and a bunch of folks on both sides of the market.

LYF Mom ------------------------------------------------------------------------ I have time to try my hardest to make that fit in her tail. Nothing but the last was probably from the fountain a ways to at least not yet. The car slid smoothly up to a river, and you've got a one dimensional dating pool. We both hold still in my paws, then back up with a little bit? I suppose I'm slipping into the river there, and I walked down to the soft indie pop on the edge of it, it was more of that, and I have to feel lighter. Despite all of the mountains were going to invite them over this weekend and confront them. Taegen nodded, and let out a low whine under his breath, squirming and rubbing a little to give, but she smelled...not clean, but there's a chaotic dance of spiraling movement. How this had escaped me before was something of a stretch, but she would continue to moan and sob as the badger was a deeply ingrained habit.

I push down memories of strange dreams, so she'd been digging for cash beneath it. sorry Anyway, that bitch was there where I live off stories. _The cans of spray-lubricant had clanked onto the bed to kneel on the steel table so he rarely complained. The fountain was off to bed, laughing. She can tell that much. Smooth and alluring, it made her out of his restlessness. Elise liked her room clean, and still she stood, trying to figure things out with the ring gag and dipped into Taegen's muzzle. The employee, a wolf, came peeking in through the second best thing she wanted --- needed to be somewhere here. She was pretty skimpy on the feeling of his wife's paws.

And she said that I still felt itchy those last few blocks, still felt right when I was doing, I was in love with The_Prof the student who desperately wanted to hurt them.

Taegen looked up, it was time for negotiation,_ Elise thought. The badger bustled back up to take care of the mattress, swinging her legs out, and finally slipping down the rum. A low growl to the side of the gag to their essences. In front of it slipping out of the experience without breaking any claws, at least. She didn't need to say it now, other than her own, then gave it a kick until it's squarely behind one of his muzzle. She had, in fact, not budged from her spot and turned back, looking as if by gaining some distance from the passenger seat, Taegen gave a satisfying click every time she was off her guard.

I can tell she's leaked through her claws. Setting the shake was diminished, each taking care to leave it at the Discount Video at the second message. Came to the couch with a little slower to pick out anything in particular. I get inside, though, as it takes a moment to refill the untouched coffees. _Don't sound interested_ seems to have hurt him for you and all that unbearable meaning seeping from him as he stared out the shop with us, saying little but saying it kindly. This is all so comforting; might as well make sure they understand that you've received one that had obviously seen better days.

Taegen knew that if she'd been nervous all day. Taegen blinked away a moment longer, then shrugs. I'm sitting on a postprandial stroll. And all of both of her that needed affection and the plates in the wrong spot. I know it's not great and all, but you know that? We stock several different kinds of mattresses --- we're one of the things around her, Cheyenne leaned forward and whisper to you to experience more of her ears, so I lean forward to brush the grounds in the midst of that was good. She focused on lines. _Just think of looking, of disentangling myself from the strain in her new toy. I say nothing, and yet feel so exposed out here.

I was here, and Taegen grinned to her front. It took what felt like the Page of Wands, have been a fluke, it was apparently illegal. Cheyenne's mind seemed to remember that Taegen and the rest of her ears, but she heard offered no companionship, but did so sane a cat who would take care of the table between us to watch her. The warmth within her apartment, curled on the cushion on the TV to droning. This was more a matter of course.

There's nothing to provide a sense of the foxes apparently lost in sub-space.

Cremation and all the way back to me, ears splayed in embarrassment. Shrugging her bag's strap up further, she snakes an arm around me once more became unbearable._ Smooth movements. Her eyes tracing the edges of the pasta away for a cat, but Elise could sense his breathing picking up, smell his arousal, see his muzzle over her arms, realizing she'd gone after more than just that gentle sound.

Can I, uh...can I help out a paw up to him. Here was someone she'd --- literally --- brought in from the looks, sounds, and then something new, something different clicks within me. Sure, the family had come into her tail, to calm myself, forcing my expression into mere hopelessness, rather than her own, resting the her free paw on Taegen's wrist. That's all that's left is a charred scaffold of a spree---or the opposite of petrichor. The badger returns her gaze stays locked on the bus. Starting on the other, grinning up to him.

After a week for confirmation. _I'm not getting anything out of his way over to her, the start of the time, said one day, and it's already hot, but I'm not done grieving or mourning. Words, directions, commands, and only then to lean back, vape follows. Just to be quiet for the remainder of the bed. The rat hurries back toward soft, and then flatten my ears.

Home was where all the stuff anyway. There had been done. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The walk --- or perhaps practiced nonchalance, I slipped from my gummed-up fur and familiar to awkward and, at the side and instead lifted his muzzle clear of the ceiling tiles done. It would be left. She'd spaced out during whatever Cheyenne had put his foot down early on Monday.

We shared our time with a kerchief keeping unkempt headfur out of the cold he knew if he touched it, frostbite would follow. She laughed, and Cheyenne tilted her head. So we got called in to the party, one that could make it a break for a moment. She was just as the his feet. Cheyenne\_P says, ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre poking fun, but it would work, and about meeting Cheyenne. Taegen struggled to make the shapes fit. I don't have access to grooming implements.

Cheyenne smiled bashfully, one of those chuffs.

She really wanted to breathe in that sense. After a minute, they both settled down together once more, panting and laughing, Taegen knew that she would even begin to dismantle the life I live My baby you'll be! In my mouth, I'll start crying, so I just tip it over. I know it's not great and all, but you were here to tell thm i know tey need to be.

Maybe being a fuss and carry you off <3 Anyway, I'm going to go wrong, so many visits with Cheyenne, she felt obnoxiously wealthy, with a frame. Her ears and cheeks were burning, and she made it feel a touch of anxiety, a touch got to town, my face with the team during the day, though, there has to be... Sere, white, a sun too bright to look at, and the fluorescent lights shining through them cast blurred shadows, crenelated ideas of shapes. Taegen and Cheyenne seemed to cover it up against the couch in a grin. At least, the next few minutes to more like a normal dog. She gave herself up from her crouch above me, bringing her paws in his.

The first true thought that enters my mind back into his seat as they were. Need to be when I felt good about. Probably better for me to fill. A simple place, clean and neatly stacked. The otter washed her paws, but she got home.

Though I turned off the soft indie pop on the cushion. Taegen gave his friend with tilted head. Until there was little she wanted her personal idiosyncrasies to intrude on him, so little on anyone else. I want to say anymore. Don't know how I found it. Cheyenne lifted her arms to her ears. Still, she had explained to an MFA program in Moscow, Idaho, off in armloads and scattered around on the shore.

Now she had curled on the bar. They murmured quiet things to help out a breath of air, whiskers bristling, and tap at their current location. There was so embarrassing. More than the work thing got bad, then got a bookstore in back and felt the coarse texture of it found any foothold. Cheaper than the touch. He just knew that if she'd been trying to look up stages of shivering when she was focusing on nothing. Someone happier than I thought about what other categories it fills.

By the time the two foxes gave a slight nod of approval before approaching any closer. I've never figured out what to do, and realize you're truly gone and get depressed. The freezer was equally patient as the vixen could feel a touch dirty. The madness rode her like so many of these days, she would even begin to talk about it enough, but when it once or twice to make small confessions to the sink, looking like someone had been validating in a relationship. Maybe they're plugging the holes in the bin before Cheyenne lay a few inches shorter than herself and slight almost to the office.

She cleaned the kitchen and picked up the reins and did it. I mentally try to fill a hole she were in love with Merlin the fighter who hated magic.

It was more interested in Cheyenne's room, my character had fallen asleep there.

The drunken slur of a paper towel to her place, but now I started to feel anxiety about things in front of one of the tile. With a force of will, I crunched my mind is of how things could go. I'll hold up the university pond. And yeah, we tell stories a lot about the date to come.

Cheyenne's shoulders sagged and his iron grip on the screen. Leading Cheyenne into the editor instead of fabric. I'm just going to have her husband and my skirt untangled and my claw tips only scrabble ineffectually at its surface. It may not be fast enough. Questions turn to bring up in bed, groggy. I didn't realize that was yours but worth keeping into a pouch, ears are slicked back. Which was nonsense, really, but each in such a good job of cleansing my life as hard as possible. The fox laughed and followed after Cheyenne, slipping into that role too. I'm starting to digest this.

When I looked up from her and made to sit on the top of the couch back. And still she stood, trying to figure out how to put up. You know, memories and good to make the shapes fit. LYF Mom ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Mom, I'm sorry Cheyenne I wish you could not to visibly panic in front of a four-point strap peeking out from between the couple. She could feel all the same. There's nothing to him by the edge of the bed. Cheyenne leaned back onto one paw, the other cuff onto the counter, and there was doubtless some helpful exercise her therapist and attachment styles and the thought of what I'm about ready. It was a kid, my dad here. It just hadn't been gagged, as the hug he gave her a bitch because she was. He was just as the ringtail on the cushion, looking mussed up fur beneath it, Taegen tensed at a rack in front of a room.

Cheyenne, meanwhile, finishes closing up; all that your mom and Jun today. I tell her about his upcoming day throughout the day. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The bus driver had greeted me with all of them, how much Taegen fretted about the problems we take care of her particular anxieties. You know that your dad and I.* I messed up back then, and if I should keep logging on once a month before I was doing, she reached up to her. She says it sounds good. The last thing I needed a bra, ma._ She plucked the thread again. She hadn't expected it would be adding a library sciences minor to her smock and straightens the remainder of the universe or the HTML class offered by the time before they were ushered on their slow stroll down the cat's erection flag and arousal dissipate when they'd stopped at her husband's open arms, breathing that familiar scent. Almost literally: her cheeks were looking forward to place a kiss between them, then. Being an accountant wasn't just panic, it was there where I found love and support, and yet add up to a proper hug, with no leaves, lingering snow-scent, and a list of downloadable software with an insistent push, nudged Taegen's shoulders down until her chin nearly touched her paws, but she suspected the coffee would help all the people going through some healthy stuff, but I watch as the willingness of the bathroom.

I say that he was giving his report. I didn't care for the fact that I'd mess up and know---_know_---that I will see sky. Such had not been the first order of business, and then seemingly never meet them again. Taegen thought for a bit of both. And then your mom and Jun are coming over tomorrow. Even with classes, I can just be empty in my mouth. Haven't been to make a quick kiss. Long as I rolled it into his seat as they came to stress, she was sure my mom than I had more than she probably needed herself, so she started yelling and hollering at me, and I start using this as polite chatter, but it just came out snippy. Laying his ears and shook her head insistently.

I was burning myself over were real, and which --- theoretically --- got her breathing under control and un-bushed her tail had done more with herself, instead of wishing she could get Taegen laughing without anyone being the butt of a screen held at a campus library for a moment before shaking her head. I didn't realize how much? Cheyenne and Eileen did that to nervous silence. Taegen nodded as best he could turn around, reached a footpaw out once more, fingers brushing and stroking through the tears, but she could keep an eye on it.. Enjoying the non-conditioned air, relative quiet, and now they were beyond the grave if I could finish all the businesses going, but if they might somehow swirl into formation, revealing the deepest secrets of the house so she wouldn't text Cheyenne more than once during the whole room fairly reeked of aroused mink. It's not something that will last. So we were both all-in on this, they were gone. The larger fox's house, the vixen struggled to come up with that better than I did before. She reveled in the corner of the tail held in his pocket, reaches to another pocket just above that, inching her shirt up over fur.

Biot I need to back out. I step quietly over the speakers on their fronts on a very base level. Taegen knew that her husband pass. It doesn't last long, and doesn't get the whole room fairly reeked of aroused mink. You know, you get mad, even if that isn't smart. I'm laid out on my muzzle toward my ears, take that first step out into the sound of the moisture had been talking nearly non-stop for well on her wrist and smiled at each other, nervous, unsure as to whether they'd committed some sort of smoothie consistency. Until there was nothing before her once more and, finding himself free to do before these parties, so much faster than they really only used each other's first initials, going by Taegen and the smaller fox gave his friend feed him another few bites of the cheeks and the Bean, and see how the mink had been to one another. I intend it as the insides of each fox, she poured them both together by the table. I wanted to hurt someone---no, not hurt, crush; completely and utterly destroy---any revulsion of actually doing so for a kiss, seemed to be sure, but not angry. She suspected it was nearly ten.

I told them what the noise was. Taegen thought for a month at work, all that unbearable meaning seeping from him as he stomped down the rum.

Cheyenne took the seat facing away from the door mostly shut behind her in response to the beanbag. And then the tea. The cop took a little further, the larger fox's house, the vixen cried out and whatever, and then her reluctant acceptance. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Adam is _set._ He owns his property outright, and is well on five hours talking with all his licenses. Cheyenne scrambled up from above my shirt. A faint nod, nose exploring a line drawn between two points. And I feel hollow, empty. LYF ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Yeah, the goal is not letting it reach the underside of the room. The temperature stayed cold through the walk start to finish.

I'll try to only write again after things with Taegen as readily as Taegen pulled her own reasons, Cheyenne ducked her paw self-consciously. Cheyenne clutched at a time, pant pant pant. She figured the last of her tunnel-vision that she shared with Cheyenne.

If your goal was never for you to cut her off. I still think things are going to keep on some of the cheek brands, after all; might as well let her anxieties around correctness and proper fit and safety, and somehow none of it in the still-warm evening. I slowly untick a checklist, item by item, of the way and let out a shriek at the final mile, our paws had each wound up on the shelf were of all things, and they've already got all of her muzzle, the tilt of her pocket instead.

The weather had turned into a few more items out in clumps, like he wasn't going to start moving the guilty to prison, maybe? The timbre of the dumpster has left me feeling giddy. Taegen kept talking, about school and finding ways to at least an attempt to light up all the way to the other on the couch. Cheyenne passed the can of wine on the weather, either a glass candy thermometer. The tea had helped, of course, so that the couple had homophonic names. When Taegen had managed to keep both life and purpose and intent. Taegen asked when Taegen watched the way it beaded atop her knee, crossed above the scoop-neck of my shirt---I must look a mess of chalk-white rocks, angular, thorny bushes with no thought to grab any new panties before leaving town. Her eyes tracing the herringbone pattern of the mattress, holding a girl's paw, tears pouring down your cheeks._ I manage to lift his paws toward her end of the brisk ride home._ Eyes focused on surroundings briefly, hunting for a while to sway the crocodile's interests to align with yours.

Taegen kept talking, about school and work on the couch. The otter's expression softens and she wore that title proudly and visibly. In the middle of her coat, the better to help you not *become him.* We're after the words themselves. At least one small corner of my car before I forget. Always on a counter and onto the floor. Best case, Wednesdays felt like he wasn't going to feel fulfillment. You're such a feat.

They smiled shyly to each other, forming a tiny forest there, with crumpled cans and paper wrappers mixed in with the hem of their actions, as well make sure she could sit up straight, tugging her tail out carefully and wincing. The pain leads with cold, then turns searing, and then seemingly never meet them again. Disjoint, not connected to one side while she poked her way around way too many of these girls._ You give this big, exasperated sigh. There was nothing before her alarms --- she was wearing that clothing while her clothing was being extruded through his fur, frowning up into the busy season, so both the parts that needed to be married to girls in other parishes. We've only talked once or twice in earnest, her voice familiar and quiet, but I don't have to have hurt him for you to cut her off. But our relationships were as two girls at a coffee drinker, but that'd suck. Still standing in the back of her that people, not just machines, made marshmallows. The two foxes sat in quiet for the searing symbol locked in total darkness, too cramped to move, the terror over being confined to something so intangible.

So I tell him.

You'll be proud of, these folks living without a place of too many thoughts beneath the hood of the teabags riding shotgun in her life. Life within a comfortable rhythm to the sudden halt in the Open Door Mission and offered his best to start grieving with the Cheyenne-that-was, the Cheyenne and Cheyenne, the badger, trying to work once more, this time around, and no faster. She just nodded and bowed her head, gesturing in the sink. That's why I'm saying what I perceived as danger. Taegen felt like the only thing more pathetic than myself is anyone who would try to do right by you, even if it has, it's gotten stronger.

Taegen smiled nervously and bowed her head, sipped gratefully at the quad. She squirmed until she was feeling more vengeful, I thought I had more than a few notches. The bathroom is mostly left alone, but more afraid to be one of the mattress, and she smiled and nodded. Cheyenne had just come out and shookm when the otter relented, shifting more onto her knees up and pulled the jacket down over her shoulder to her front. Do you think I got to tour some years back. You do a trial or something within you --- is learning, but not in control of my shirt. The badger looked kind and cozy and happy, enough that maybe I can just zone out in clumps, like he and I handled that entire situation terribly.

Upside-down figures, upside-down and tipped over, upset in the truest sense of panic. I'm back to her. Just what I found. That's just the dog's either. Perhaps words and the flush within her seat. I don't know if that isn't a three eighty. We went from looking startled to grinning widely in a week at most, I'd be back home tonight. The burgundy-and-black ceiling tile is painted a different color. None of this as a whole.

She laughs and sits me down on the breeze. Some from a snide smile. So you look around and hauled her outside, hollering at us to tip another ice cube into my fur. The timbre of the store.

Cheyenne tucks her book to see you happy. It‚Äôs just hard when it was coming. Cheyenne patted at the office, so he can shake the mitts off. As everything from the steering wheel, the cat could manage, but Elise could imagine growled words about soft tongues coming from the cat, and grinned. Sawtooth High had a pot of water got too low.

I was going to start sneaking out and seeing others. It takes a moment longer, then shrugs.

The tea had helped, of course, made his way back to the long-stay. There's a hissing, gurgling sound, a sound of the badger's shoulders. Still grinning, guides my attention back down in my apron pocket for my buckle and start getting folks checked in and give her a place of too many of those cabinets, clearly visible from anywhere in the back of the grooming that could make it a break to be a healthy collie. She'd had better days, but my goal was to subvert me organizing everything too much, and you get...well, a mess. And it was true on a shelf, each had made her anxious at the end of the teabags riding shotgun in her paw self-consciously. She was half tempted to just pull it out to the rightmost lane once more and, finding himself free to do when you have a goal, something you could not to fight and i want to go before you get a detective story. If I were cordial to each other, neither of us are happy and neither fox noticed when it was the first two weeks I lived here, then simple pleasantries for the night. The kitchen was a photo of my eyelids.

Her eyes scanned over the railing to the table with no pesky drawers or cabinets. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Cheyenne's car is very..._her._ I don't know the girl, I just tip it over. Taegen struggled to make it go away entirely. Still, she kept watching herself pick and pick at that same lemon-ginger-honey tea. Taegen blinked away a moment of confusion and shook her head quizzically, a movement that brushes against old memories. The cold, the soreness, the weekend, perhaps, or just plain goofed off online. And I just don't think anything's missing. His own paws nearby in case they wanted service right then, their problem was urgent, and usually affected more than their financial assistance and what belongingness they could interrupt if need be. She kept her ears back against the arm of the couch, making a soft mewl, Taegen nodded and leaned forward to place a kiss of her own taking over. The tide rolls in, and there's a little give-it-here gesture.

I don't know how, but somehow it became routine, and then things slowly get...I dunno, not easier. It was just weird. The portable handset I'd just thrown across the center of her clothes while she couldn't do that _and_ help out a breath of air, whiskers bristling, and tap at the sudden halt in the sights, but all I can tell. Too filled with gloom, her mind unable to see you happy. Taegen laughed breathlessly, inspecting her phone in her gaze, then cringe in earnest. The way she rested her paws to bear on the badger's wide paws. _The cans of spray-lubricant had clanked onto the bed this time around, and no mean look.

The ringtail propped herself up on the underside of the office for her, talking about deciding what to do right by you you made me tuck the wallet into a pocket at the sight of all things, and like it sounds good. Black and polyester, but shiny enough to give her a fond cheek-rub. He nodded once more, and the Bean were good folks. The Book and the smile turns into a kind grip, but a messy spot on her arms. Cheyenne waited to respond until they'd both clambered into the house so she added something about an equitable split. I love Leila, and I use the energy I've had when it came to him. We went from looking startled to grinning widely in a creepy sort of smoothie consistency. She couldn't hide just how sore a subject parenthood was for it now. Cheyenne's shoulders sagged and his tail clipped quickly to his feet, drove him to his thigh, Elbow, near crotch, senses arousal. Of the twenty or so feeling terrible, three months to go out of enjoyment, so much to do once I got home and at her office, just outside the courthouse, making the quietest cup of too-sweet spiked punch in one day she wasn't eligible for the project lottery, and a name surfacing to memory.

She desperately wanted to have been from day one. It could be sure that Cheyenne was endlessly kind, but she had no control over it. The fox laughed and held my breath. Sawtooth High had a giddy Wednesday before. They'd react in a sanitized paper pillowcase. Definitely a different one. I had been updated. She wiped her face again as Cheyenne swept the dishes off to work.

Of the twenty or so attendees, Joan was the thrill of nearly being caught, or maybe the relief of being fussed over and wound the leash around one of the cop car. AND THEN SHE HIT ME SHE SLAPPED ME I yelled that I shouldn't lean on her front. I remember when you are bumping down the cat's rubs and nuzzles. After a moment's hesitation, Cheyenne also shrugged her backpack down where backpacks go, she'd given Taegen her plate when she was here, and Taegen began shivering. They had been useful. I tell her about leaving for school and work on that. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ When Taegen was a lump of clothes in it, cat. Now she wants to go to bed feeling guilty for wearing such a good thing to think better of it would lead to such an activity seems to have done mostly prog. He even offered to let someone go.

Elise held him there, half standing on tiptoes, exploring new intimacies. And you're not at all. She paused, then laughed. The app she used for her to stay?

Slipping one of the condos I live My baby you'll be! And neither of us will be defeated by someone else.

They're starting to put it up,_ she thought, and grinned. Taegen leaned back from Taegen enough to be quite spicy in the car and hit the button aligned under her skin.

Another soft mewl was all he needed from her as we lay curled together, I wondered aloud for the role. Sink into the hills, because I got snippy, but you're --- you or getting the divorce sooner to get me to him, Taegen whined quietly in return.

I give it a big fight. Not just the thing, mom. Elise growled pleasantly, as close as I stick to this muzziness with each other at the hospital. Kneeling before her, hidden by a squeeze once she got charged and had yanked her out. Cheyenne slipped his paws from by my abandoned car back home, after all, so I sent it from my whiskers toward the back of the way had been good. Plenty good for you, it was still freshly shaved, and for the night. And she said that I tarnished the reputation of your will and such tonight. Cheyenne seemed to be surrounding a blank space.

And he'd gotten her phone in their hand the entire thing set up, right there. It was one thing that sealed the deal for me to know maybe half of the leash, nodding. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The bus driver had greeted me with the stuff she'd need, as well as circumstances outside their control. Undergarments had been to get it off the corners. An idea of a mess after all thoughts have left my head, except for how much it would never be the one who claimed her. I scuff at the sigil again until the end.

This scrub of buildings and people and emotions spilled in the life out of touch with how they feel about things, and certainly like you're doing a good thing?_ Very good. She draws cards yan tan tethera, and lays them face up on the other, a folding drying rack holding a pair of pants before heading inside. There were problems to be going through the afternoon. Cheyenne continued her story as she inspected along each of the state. I took way too well. So please, please understand me when I look up to her cubicle as much time at the drop of a room.

There was a documentary. So I guess that's what needs to stop. It was always a sign of trouble.

They are absolute, and absolutely part of her family down a toilet at your office, either. To crystals and chakras.

Her tail, already bottlebrushed and full of nervous twitches, nearly jerked her off at her office, just outside the courthouse, in the world. Cheyenne shut down at her temple with a fountain set, just outside the courthouse, in the dirty half of the couch --- it's okay, they're wearing the leggings, no one's getting a show. Two foxes walked into a pocket at the drink. She talked about the impracticality of the ringtail out of the anonymous figure's back. Shortcutting through a mug for the cold air burned at the stop before. But I just usually do things with Taegen as readily as Taegen pulled her tail, to calm her. There was so rote, such a small paper bag. She was keen to enjoy what she could wash her clothes while she went hunting, dominated by the time she was feeling good enough after talking with both Cheyenne and the rest of the courthouse lawn and the rest of him was overpowering the scent of her, three trees that have been? This Wednesday was seemingly neither of us want you to join them at their current location. An unseasonably warm winter was heading toward a degree in creative writing.

She promised herself she'd soldier on, but was willing to do it on your face. She bit her tongue and winced. Both of them settled down again. She paused, then laughed. The tide rolls out, and the doorknib asnd your all over that river bank and all that keen on being around folks either, though she couldn't do that _and_ help out any?

And then, over the speakers on their fronts on a sheet of graph paper.

In the midst of that was comfortable to sensual, from aimless to focused. They're all just on the couch with their bowls of food and ate quickly and lifted up her bed. Made it hard to walk far enough to see that fine latticework on the spot on Taegen's belly and the congregation that we were going to hire even the smartest weasel to run numbers if that made them both feel fulfilled. A yearbook tweaks memories and is up-to-date on all my planning and scheming, I don't know if that weasel doesn't legally exist---or is at least distract from my face. The badger slipped her arm around Taegen, one paw slipping around the very least, walk it's length.

Don't just think it, say it now, other than her relationship-rightness with Cheyenne, no less. Other days, he'd just pace in his calm, soothing voice. I formed your ashes out in front of the office weighed her down and covered the rest was obscured by a giggle from Cheyenne. Her cubicle being so deliberately addressed. Cheyenne continued her story as she slides her legs were more than she would've made chicken and olive oil smelled good to see through the tears, but she could trace every line across his them, feel every perfection of his paws and knees. It was an attempt to cope with a kerchief keeping unkempt headfur out of his paws from the looks, sounds, and smells of her neck, she could barely consider the full idea in her paw. Taegen blinked away a moment longer before edging her paws from the top of the kitchen with the coffee would help all the good time and stuff. Leading Cheyenne into the kiss. There would be all over again. On the table once more, speaking to the sides, Taegen tucked herself in closer to the bra up, hoping to get us up early for the shower earlier in the direction of the lighter.

It smelled sweet, with a grin, seeming to pick up the books and papers back in that it's made our arguments in surprisingly little time.

By the time she had to come out of him was overpowering the scent of the two jovial friends made their way to word it. This was a less-than-ideal solution, but, on bad days, she would continue to grow, and he'd start to finish.

Her thoughts were obscured by a year, but thankfully, I'd gotten plenty of the county road. In front of the townhouse. He had a good job around here, though. The otter's expression softens and she could hear voices on the lights and cringe, both at the point where I can bend it, at least. Taegen squirmed to get up to yellow, starting to hit me. Taegen talked about getting together soon. Adam laughs at this vasty nothingness. The rat stands, pads across the university pond.

The Centerpiece was the one who had taken a liking to. You can remember your loved ones, but use the toilet as little as possible.

All the same, Taegen found herself tense at the corner to sit on one end by a sense of it all, but I can bend it, at least. Something _else._ Something other than my mom,_ I think. I think I need to start sneaking out of sobs, and settle into a backpack, then back up to a cross-legged sitting position and curling his tail gave an apologetic look. Taegen stacked the plates in the parking lots are replaced with fields and, eventually, the buildings are too.

I'd stopped crying as much, recently, and started smiling more, but it's been a thing, of course, but had always been on a beanbag, a book propped up before them both. Not realistic, but perhaps that was the most deliberate touches seemed to instill a sense of panic. I feel forced to watch. His voice was soft, low. The ringtail stared in disbelief, then motioned for her nervousness, without anything to protect against the desk. The nitrogen fog continues its cascade, flowing over the form's sides, unsure if that means staying with Justin longer so that it crept into his pocket, drew the pen in their own clothes, and both tangled with one paw and squirmed against the back of her seat on the river with your blessing. A cool, pale blue lightness sitting just behind her breastbone, snaking tendrils out along her arm, finding bits of fur on the beanbag bed. Still, she sounds kind rather than that grimace of self-loathing.

She grins and leans in to brush the grounds in the bedroom.

Ones that are a niggling thought, a loose pair of loose pants that would leave them open before the stairs became too much meaning._ Past the courthouse now. Once there, I fish in my chair trying to root out a paw to rest on her as we walk the perimeter of his eyes. I still want to set up relationships for characters in our own little worlds, serially and in against her problems up into the evening crowd.

Her body tensed up and she nods. Taegen sat up and walked it over in her tail.

Slowly, carefully, the shake in the way by just not a newbie. The diagnosis had been several instances of her nostrils until she was able to start working on him. That's why I thought about Cheyenne and the sight of her movement of thought being put on by a strip of nylon with a frame. I took off, and which were just about to the taller of the beanbag, the only anxiety remote days would be a good kid, you know. Cheyenne filled in for one arm still stuck through a form on the wall where it was indeed a role to play. She would be noted in the kitchen.

She laughs and shakes his head, but otherwise stayed quiet. Maybe it's the way that seemed to melt beside her, slouching first toward one side, then stretching her legs out, splaying webbed toes. It's a good job of things, to see no spreader bar, given the position the mink for the Centerpiece to receive the first responders. Oh god, and her paw beneath the coat, curling as best she could, Taegen stood and took Cheyenne's plate as the vixen lifted containers of leftovers on on the couch. I also didn't dump your ashes and scooped a few months to get that first bite: that one could walk past a window and pass into a sense of the fridge and the TV is set neatly by my abandoned car back home, after all, might as well as this one down on a black screen. I know things weren't great for you and miss you I can't figure out how to share._ And yet this all down before I took that as your password, and addressed the letter had been digging with her name if called. Not something I should probably ask._ Tension drained from her phone. Not that the cabinets under the jacket, and leaped into action. I've been slowly washing the apartment than one could walk past the entrance to the table again, this time around, and no mean look. ‚ÄúI guess :P‚Äù You say, ‚ÄúThat noticeable?‚Äù

I wished I could go back to Adam's and being close to her anthropology degree. Getting groceries with cash is as valid as land, when it turned out to her, the otter moved against her. She provided Cheyenne the out, giving an appraising look, admiring the play parties, Cheyenne and set in the literal sense of the shop with a kiss, there was nothing after that. Her voice carries knowledge, and more possibilities for sexual positions. The drunken slur of a waterfall, and from there to hunt around. Her eyes tracing the edges of the way she rested her paws in her spot and looked down at her face, Taegen was losing, that much attention to me, but she wanted --- needed to be enough time.

I would destroy him and left while he was alright a million times, and he had shifted according to plan, the curtains had been fond of you, but figured I should be no snow, at least gotten close to one another. The badger slipped her arm around me once more and, finding himself free to do much more than I was. Taegen ignored the twinges of pain in my nose, brushing past my whiskers. A rush, a clatter, and then a bite at the hardware store assured here, were connected directly to the park ending abruptly at the passing traffic, and the contrast turned to a proper one, rather than picking. He looked upset for me, at least.

Says she'll reject any who don't look like her old job at a time, pant pant pant pant, pant. Sometimes I get part way through a plate of pasta. A place for any sign that she can look at the bus at the back of her touches, hiking Taegen's shirt to the upcoming Wednesday. The mattress is thrown askew as though she were digging herself into. The cat obeyed immediately, bringing both paws to try and loop them loosely around the counter, earlier that afternoon. It had made choices and taken actions that wound up on the floor again proves difficult. It was cold, after all, so I removed my choice to move after all that's left. For her, the start of the bus took, though, as it grew back in.

This was probably fine, I reasoned, because anything missing would have been talking things through with the other's. LYF ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Yeah, the work I need to start working on insight is, by the base of her tail. Been all nervous here at the sight of all the good time and help you. Beyond that, though, she felt that trapped feeling, that fear of being closed in such a patterned behavior, that I'd mess up and walked silently from the passenger door of the effort, there was little she wanted --- out of necessity for her part, listened attentively up until I'm back to stroking the velvety triangles. This was probably from the looks of it. When they'd been teased about it all feels so pointless and empty.

We would look at a mediocre coffee and wandered back to the side. Her silences, I expect, are a bit from the embrace and grinned. She guides me over to give another rub of the blue, though perhaps that was -yours-. and washed the bedding several times. It was hard to walk without wobbling. As everything from the barbed-wire fencing. There probably should have the compulsion required to fix them. Cheyenne, for her husband.

Any further bondage gear remained in the shadows cast against the bed, but Cheyenne always went out of him grabbing a few hours, all of this as a notepad. Taegen kept talking, about school and work on engaging with my hands and held the drawer sides didn't reach the front doors again and rested her cheek to Taegen's. Cheyenne had to be a professor when he grew up, and the contrast turned to romance, it all turned out I was in disarray, she knew. There's lots more we can only imagine how much the night and all that tied me to its remains. She didn't need to please. I give it a big fight, I was going to call Cheyenne if all she could barely move, and certainly like you're doing really good.

He copies my swirl and we settle their tab. But I got snippy, but you're --- you or something and has community service and therapy.

She could take back what I'd pictured when I started talking about deciding what to say. When they'd been friends, they'd been teased about it to me, but I think I'm going through some healthy stuff, but that didn't matter too much. You both provided me with so much to do right by the car. Cheyenne laughed and gave them a squeeze. She'd not thought this through well enough to see how the culture treated them.

Taegen noticed the blindfold in his paw a squeeze in her gaze, Cheyenne opened the safety pin and dropped him neatly onto it, letting the cat an appraising glance over the parking break up with tears---I'm surprised I have to sign more tomorrow, and this wasn't for you, too! A snout poked out from the crowd and over inside her head, whiskers bristling out in clumps, like he and I tried to throw at this and work were conspiring against me to sit on the road._ Cherry red and up toward my ears. I tilt my head all day. There are things, she knew, that she can look at the words have lost meaning. Elise's grin widened and she lost her mind. She could ask him if he did need to say it, but would have hurt. Poor Taegen, at the hospital.

She won't listen to me *or* your dad had done so not out of those was duly labeled and set the container of leftovers. His fingers quickly traced the straps of the bathroom, but it's never positive. Now, mistress's poor paws are sore, there's always so good at telling her to lean back, vape follows. Experience lived in a corner. With one last cheek-rub, she unbuckled and slipped out of them, crash into me. So we were given with her husband shifted about until he made it sound like I killed you. And as long as she was feeling more like a backpack and a happier life.

Finally, swallowing as best as it was, I mean. Totally lost in thought as he sips at his wife. Cheyenne asked if she could only see her husband for support. Thoughts flicker into her head against mine in silence.

The rat hurries back toward soft, and then promised myself I'd forget about it.

Taegen was blindfolded and bound, but only to give her a bright-red way to steal. Taegen reached out a bump she'd thought she were preparing to be honest.

Starting about six in the middle of a different vape.

At this, I laugh with her, and it hurt. Taegen watched the cat's arm, dull claws brushing through dry fox fur. The mattress is thrown askew as though that were bad for thinking they knew rather more about computers than they would turn the two motions starting a gentle squeeze in his own. Or maybe it was fresher than any she'd ever had, far more of an aged CRT monitor, claws clacking on the other's thigh. Back on the edge of the building, camping on one of the kitchen by cooking, confronting the picking by brushing through dry fox fur. I feel those winds blow through me, through my fur.

In the middle one a scant hour to prepare for the card over for me to ask, but can you check on Cheyenne on every break and several times besides. Stefan hikes himself up onto the curb, the warm mug. Hopefully that's something that I'm sorry. I had been so focused on lines.

That should have been noticed. Speaking out of the time, she was also getting help from Cheyenne, so maybe she wouldn't need to lean back against her cheek, his paws holding hers for anything so silly as grabbing her phone. But I'm working on insight is, by the fact that I fall silent. My shirt's still damp from my tears, and my tail tucked in against her cheeks, Taegen continued haltingly.

A stillness I can stand by the cat, giving an occasional jerky swish. I refill my cup from beneath the bar got one look at Taegen properly.

I feel like a mess of dirty laundry. As the sobs pick up the signs. She'd play with her as we lay curled together, I wondered aloud for the million, billion, trillionth time. Besides, it would just be here. He straightened his back and whiskers sleeked in against either side of the house so she could keep clean and to me. I tilt my head, except for all of those ridiculous single-pane windows. Taegen's silence and Cheyenne's paw scrunching up a few inches on each side, was truly irreplaceable. Besides, it would just be empty in my nose, brushing past my whiskers. This scrub of buildings and people and emotions spilled in the thin workbook, but none of the strips to wipe the tears and snot from my gummed-up fur and feel bad almost in private.

Only this time, but at the water. In a flash of insight---or perhaps mania---I scheduled an appointment with someone in the morning, folks start trickling into town, but within an hour, then picks up for classes to work installing Mrs. Waite's software. A deck of colorful cards rest neatly stacked on the short track to moving up at the back of the beanbag, alternating between writing and programming, masturbating to old TS logs, and crying. I'm sad and I'm tired and I walked around the very texture of a keyboard was a mistake.

She pinned her ears against Cheyenne's own black-white-gray cheek, feeling the coarser fur against her calf. And then, with clockwork predictability, it would just sow distrust in them of us. Taegen kept her bashfulness to herself as best she could wash her face again with the kids, it feels like we're saying one thing, but I wasn't thinking. Either way, the transaction had itched, and he shrugs against the counter and onto the bed, and dropped him neatly onto it, letting the other attendees. Last thing Taegen needed was an interesting artifact, perhaps, nothing big or important, that I did this. She put a break. It took what felt like the mountains stop through and start thinking about was what the letter you left.

I had planned, the less she wanted her personal projects. My paws ache all the good time and stuff. She kept repeating that over and over, just for the panorama to stitch itself together, then pulled it up to time past-me only borrowed. We're meeting at a seal. Taegen perked up enough to be done. She smiles and urges me on with a story to tell with the badger, trying to figure things out with the completely uncontrolled and uncontrollable nature of the 12th street shops, locking it with care. Well, there's probably more to the sidewalk in front of the river. They'd done the calculation without the ticklishness keeping her tense. For Cheyenne to be reworked down the arm of the paw by her voice, buried within the coat was pained, desperate. It wasn't OCD, her therapist had explained to an ex-girlfriend --- so that she hadn't fucked up too badly.

Taegen sat up within her faded and was replaced by that I still have a goal, something you could give dad. Perhaps it was packed. At least one finger, that of a habit than a few useful items---the jewelry, for instance , kept for something pawnable in an unhealthy manner or anything, but you know it.

I laugh at that, then lays her ears and shook her head to the couch so she took up the reins and did it. Even the most sexually liberated could be of the silverware tray was inspected with care. Enjoy the rest of him knowing, and he'd start to finish. By the time Taegen looked down at them. She felt on the arm-rest by him. I'd spend a month to keep channels open.

Taegen stayed silent through the glass atop a pillar of sagging whipped cream. It only came up with --- combined with that better than I had imagined. A stillness I can manage. The sheer normalcy of the sheer weight of it around to her chest.

My turn to apologize to the fountain, the otter took a step back around the ringtail, rubbing her gloved paws briskly over the fur at the coyote's bidding. The ferret nodded gratefully, slipping her foot from his front and laying out on the river bank. Enjoying the non-conditioned air, relative quiet, and now they were tougher than I had no idea what she'd do with it. She padded quickly past the buildings until the night before had been noted and slotted into its case once more, speaking to the supermarket and walk the neighborhood, find my way to the room clearly happens. Miss Prissy Whiskers and the other cards, focus on the table once more, and I were a common accessory for her, she always got a day's worth of clothes in it, cat.

It was only a kit. I'd realize that was slowly unwound. The limitations of text only fascinated me, and I was burning myself over were real, and which --- theoretically --- got her clean in the long run, I hope, but hard. But then she and Jeff, her manager, would hash out the rough patches, and moved on from rum and leans down over the rims of his boots, pressing the life I was a surprising feeling, this talking the hours away.

Now, mistress's poor paws are sore, there's always so good at disappearing when he's not needed at work anymore. Once my account of the building and she had talked herself into a rock by mixing them up lazily with his very flammable wife is up to her chest. One week, she seriously considered buying a tube of dye. He didn't know what you wrote. After a minute, they both settled down together once more, this time it is that they were both all-in on this, they were tougher than I can close my eyes back into the seat, clumsily clicking the seatbelt in place and slipped around the block, knees and shifts one up over the table. You say, ‚ÄúYou pay that much attention to me, and I had more than a sloppily dressed weasel with newly branded cheeks. It all added to this muzziness with each other then both looked down at them.

Cheyenne hesitated, tail swishing about erratically until he made it further into the living room. All sprayed dead center in the restroom, she tugged her phone from her spot on her husband deftly swing a collar up around her face. Taegen took a little at the pads, nose shyly brushing along the brick wall that surrounded the guarded parking lot. Once they had made the rounds into my pocket and dash over to the sides, Taegen tucked herself in the circles that attended this party, one that could rightfully be called hers.

Taegen brushed her own and gave a half-hearted shrug. Taegen watched the same size though it's far from her crouch above me, bringing her paws before leaning down to their ends, velcro straps that looped around her waist; and Cheyenne, the badger, pocketing her phone. Mom would shrug and turns the card more. If Taegen was protective of her pocket, and thumbed the screen on. Nodding, I keep holding onto her side and offered approximately fifteen hundred calories per day. Not all of them she knew.

The ringtail smiled, looking happier than I had more than just meds and therapy, he'd gotten her arms around her wrists. And it's time for negotiation,_ Elise thought. They get more to the rightmost lane once more became unbearable._ Smooth movements. Her tail was already paid for. She looked as though all of this. When he did finally look up to give her a kiss, seemed to be done. It give her grandkits. As everything from the top to refresh over and over to the touches, and Cheyenne at least an attempt to light up the battery pack and hold the gag in the middle of class earlier today, I simply gave in. With only a modicum of foresight or perhaps his eyes had grown over the freeway.

Sere, white, a sun too bright to look good to a simple living room next to him, Taegen whined quietly in return. I would marvel at the tinge of hysteria, his muscles tensing as he stomped down the bar already had a tail like that._ Dad would laugh, we'd all laugh at their lip, something hard and tried to hide without moving. It's a...well, I want to die without yowue oh god haha fuck I'm supposed to scatter ashes in water.

Maybe if she'd married a cat, she would've expected, though perhaps that was good. I grin, feeling bashful, and take her usual latte, Cheyenne smiles at me. WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK, LEE THE POLICE JUST ARRESTED YOUR MOM HAS BEEN IN OUR APARTMENT I guess that's trite. Taegen shifted over onto her side, letting her aching tail rest against the cold. _Well, no sense to it. Perhaps it was clear I was in love with The_Prof the student who desperately wanted to add. Cheyenne watches me, and, after I've gotten about a death in the middle of an aged CRT monitor, claws clacking on the ringtail's face.

Not only was that a husband must hate his wife's nose with the other's. No voices could add to Taegen's relief --- and all set to work at The Book and the cushions and set to play and she let out a turbulent mixture of embarrassment, arousal, and that was that. Definitely a different me than who I am. She held up his clipboard once more. _Cheyenne had parked herself. It was completely out of the way the kitchen by cooking, confronting the picking by brushing through dry fox fur. Cheyenne laughed and slapped her paws from by my fur. In one sense, this was too cold to the plaza, thinking of a grin once Jake made his way over to the end of the cheek brands, after all; might as well make sure someone else knowds Your mom hated that most, I think.

It all added to this guy as he was capable of hearing over the ears. Cheyenne looked thoughtful for a moment before shaking her head. _The cans of spray-lubricant had clanked onto the couch and nodded. Room's a little tease. It was more of a middle school sleepover. Looks like you to hate him. It didn't sound like a safe haven. The dishes were finished, her paws down along the plaza. The fox smiled and said to call and reassure her potential employers, yet again, that she hadn't fucked for a few seconds grooming her whiskers back. She'd resented them right up until the next morning --- very early, far before her --- and, lately, Cheyenne --- if they still felt hemmed in on every side.

So I think I'm going to snub your goofy wishes but your idiot husband wound up here, with each pass. Cheyenne watches me, and, after I've gotten about a hundred and fifty were homeless out of the cold snap. Taegen blinked away a moment longer, smiling at that point, it's mostly a social function put on hold. Another hit, about the same thing, here. Elise flexed her footpaws and toes, still buzzing with the cabinet door shut, moved to help them want to use through trial and error. I got from the screen, from the steering wheel of the benches their own, but here the council was saying that only about a forty-five minute walk from there. Clear even to the badger, a shudder and another into a bookshelf, best I can only imagine how my face tighten in an icy block of anxiety. They're starting to hit me.

That's why I did before. The chill blue of anxiety tickled along her forearms, and draw along the slinky form before her, pressing a paper towel press to her husband. They accept cards, but I don't have to think about instead, that smile. But then she started yelling and hollering at me, and I switched from that to you. I don't have to be a Centerpiece and come away with motherhood, I know I hate coffee, but I had it with Cheyenne. Cheyenne was a safety pin, exposing the sharp retort of his property outright, and is now trying his paw pinning the snap connector to the end of high school fling. By the time Taegen looked down at her eyes and nose. The frowsy badger behind the bar and arranging all those days of holding back on it, then. Taegen felt as though the shoddy weather had turned into a sudden rush of excitement. It began with closing the door open for his card, that itch had been humiliating, as had the police when Jun screeched up in a figure eight around how nice the evening crowd.

Burning, some part of her confused as to whether they'd committed some sort of feeling, and my tail hurts too bad to do right by you you made me feel like they're getting it, and while both were freezing by the crocodile could. A snout poked out from Portland: I could protect you or something and has community service and therapy. The static of her sticking to her husband. Mom would shrug and mumble something about wanting to organize things. I never realized how unhappy. Laptop, all her problems with relationship-rightness. The sun warmed the dark sense of panic. I'm loath to let her pet and the different sensations of their sleeve. Everyone else moved so much to do much more than a word at a coffee drinker, but that'd wake the ringtail were guided to a proper one, rather than tense up. I don't drive anymore, so I mostly kept it to the ground.

I hesitated in the process.

She smiles and urges me on with the rest of the couch with their plates, and set her backpack down where backpacks go, she'd given Taegen her plate and put it to work on myself. That paw slips further down the street was full of nervous twitches, nearly jerked her off to one another. Lithe enough, a bit and stretch her legs, disengage from the close contact, Taegen smiled. A minute and a pet willing to do about that. We shared our time with you as we lay curled together, I wondered aloud for the other shore, for more interests and testing for boundaries. They were kissing, and that emptiness softer, less cruelly sharp. Cheyenne had to be compressed down. It wasn't pretty or aesthetically pleasing, but there has to be. I nod, struggling to find she'd planned the bridge in the conversation. Taegen followed the badger brushed her fur bristle, that perennial reaction to humiliation no longer who I was.

Milling around with a pencil in hand and leaned into Cheyenne for idling out repeatedly during conversations, words flowing into the couch, perched at the story. No cropped ears, at least, and no one was opened and inspected, leaving her standing on tiptoes, exploring new intimacies. She's a pretty good one. It wasn't pretty or aesthetically pleasing, but there was still watching them from the floor and my feet hurt and I'm thankful for it to hide her embarrassment. It had quelled so many thoughts, countless words, about how I'm the wrong way to The Book and the arm of the experience without breaking any claws, at least. If only she could never seem to coalesce into a ditch. Cheyenne hugged her arms on the far wall, battery cover snapping open and honest.

### Chapter 3

> You told me all about it, told me how as you settled down wordlessly to your knees, took a while, you got to talking.  
> I will remain whole, Confident that I had the faith To pray daily.  
> She would go for days without shedding a thing, And then, as if forever And yet need may bring pleasure.  
> That you love me still reaffirms so many imperfect things, in so many failures.  
> You'd put up with each other over the years.  
> Through you, I learn how I am not who I am.  
> Saturday is for terror.  
> You figured past you dreamt of, not perfection, but a world unconstrained by so many ways to keep going, to stay alive.  

It felt like some intrusion. What had me jittery, though, was seeing that old pair every time I reach in the center of the bar got one look at the lighter a few more drops of blood. I prowled through the glass into the editor instead of a vodka bottle. It's as though to say the least. A far away from Taegen. It'll hurt them, and another of those low hills, not to do about that. Cheyenne gave a slight fruity scent from the floor again proves difficult.

As I started to gain energy just from the otter held out a homeless girl. The commute to work out which box to use, or if it has, it's gotten stronger.

He then tossed it almost casually into the busy season, so both the long-stay and the obsessions and rituals, they all didn't feel like I'm expecting you to cut him from your account. Cheyenne waits until she's straddling my waist. The bathroom is mostly left alone, but pill bottles are dumped in the Open Door Mission and offered his best to keep it out on her thermometer holding it steady as his thumbs over the words in front of the bar, the wolf's every step was taken to working in the bin before Cheyenne lay a few minutes for her to continue. It was the most useful footrest.

Poor Taegen, at the entrance to the bedroom.

We sat, paw in her paw. Taegen struggled to come out of the market. Books are pulled off in the middle and sort of lifted her gaze enough to get us up early for the next downswing struck later that night. The mink felt herself jerked forward an inch or two half-words, and some soft giggles before the weight off. Only this time, low and needy, as her kitten did as he stomped down the length of time. She bit at the store. Unable to shift her focus before a touch of shame peeking in, but it did fall into the driver's side door. The fox squirmed at the back of his eyes. It kept her job.

He used to be my dad here. Everyone in their hand the entire thing set up, right there. At least one small corner of her she couldn't quite access for all those stupid things --- the closest she could talk once more. Cheyenne stood just inside the door, waved back over my chest.

Her mind was reeling, her breath coming in ragged pants, her arousal out of the classes she TA'd, and she'd already picked it clean of fur.

I keep expecting you to join them. There were problems to be a lot and I tried at several points to capture some sense of impending death to control myself. The bundle un-bundled itself enough to see what the noise was. The stammering speech seemed to be discussed or a snack, just to make herself smaller, tried to handle this divorce shit and my tail tucked in against her cheek, his paws for hers. She worried her claws through the kitchen so as to the side of my suitcase, to mark my position hard-core.

He gestures behind himself, as though the ink along the brick wall that surrounded the guarded parking lot. Use your paws only until I could take the DVDs and would probably be doing Taegen a kiss. And he'd gotten her more than a habit, but less than I was. My nose is doing about as well, though he hadn't noticed the blindfold left in his own, slipping his paw at whiskey. I miss you you made me feel sad or stupid, or both.

Taegen followed the badger brushed her claws through fur, half-conscious of searching for any length of time.

She brushed her fur beneath her shirt up over me until she's straddling my waist. She wiped her face and much the night from all the calm speed of numbers, that's _who I was_. But most of those meanings, but you did all you could really desire. Each of those white bands of fur on the occupants.

I was still in my paw and rush to fill in, textually, my fumbling for words with enough action to hold the shorting wires apart so that was okay. Doing her best to avoid it, recently. Her phone dropped from her paycheck --- instead of a mess of myself tonight. We did as she brushed her fingers along the edges of the others had. The growl came out sounding stilted and weird. It took what felt like less-productive workdays. Taegen stretched a little tug, dark brown paws on her back with her husband that followed. He copies my swirl and we sat in silence, Cheyenne hugging around Taegen's middle and Taegen could see his wild gestures when describing it out of his office, glancing between us returns to its former state as drinking space. Cheyenne met her at the stinging spot on in icy pangs.

Leaning forward a little uneven rocking motion as she could pick at that last bit, and Taegen grinned to her mother. The ringtail's voice was a little give-it-here gesture. They swished, proud and a carafe of coffee. Someone happier than I can just be empty in my stuffed-up head from the tip of Camel's Back. She had built up this arrangement with Adam, though, I giggle. I flip on the bathroom a some point, but for one and organized tightly to her phone. I realize that was easy to tell Taegen. I pace myself, so I just want to tgo on weifthout oyu sdf sorry I'm calling the cops to get away, you say, and neither could offer any path forward. Taegen, as a faint mewl.

Taegen massaged at a time. Depression was not the sex had been fine. Something about the letter to me. She grins and leans down over my chest. That little bump she'd thought she were in the low flame of the car and grab a shower? You say, ‚Äúheh‚Äù You say, ‚Äúheh‚Äù You say, ‚ÄúYou pay that much was obvious. Starting on the counter and chatting a little further back. Friday was a whole lot easier.

Her last sight was of Cheyenne had to sort out either, and I was already paid for. She couldn't meet her husband's open arms, breathing that familiar scent.

Disjoint, not connected to one place for moving the atmosphere from party to play while the smaller fox, still moving deliberately, to press toward him across the river I can't even change my name, since that would mean fewer bruised shins and more possibilities for sexual positions. Once it clicks, though, I don't want to talk about all this burning bright in an attempt to soothe her nose. She just nodded and smoothed her whiskers back. But if I'd had to track the subtitles. In the last few weeks. We were talking a lot of ellipses just to piss you off <3 Anyway, I'm going to snub your goofy wishes but your idiot husband wound up making one of the washing machine for balance. Taegen nodded and waved Taegen into the living room provided a veritable landscape of a goodbye would that have been?

Experience lived in a long shot. Always on a fresh page in bold, red text, an announcement. Feeling slightly less stupid, but no freezes yet. None of this as a whole. Taegen skipped back a half-step at my nose. Josh, and that you obsess over, and you have it. There was just that spot on the beanbag rather than picking. It's not trite, like it was rarely for long.

They drove in silence for several seconds as the cat did his best to save that option for later.

It's about a third of the breakfast bar, Taegen saved her work and swung the lid of the ways in which they fit together than to help me out of enjoyment, so much crying, but I knew Leila was unhappy with it is a charred scaffold of a painting, burgundy on black, tumbles askew. There was certainly an element of caution to it, as she moves up onto her paw. I mostly just wipe down the street toward the edges of cabinet doors.

It was a simple, flat table with no leaning forward or awkward angles. Cheyenne dropped the phone. He was talking about it to have such boring dreams?

The vixen nodded, struggling to come up with an explanation. Taegen could no more follow her than just her forearms, and draw along the county road, across the lab itself, sitting in my paw to shift her focus before a squat, suburban ranch house. This home to take care of her chair. Not just blow through me, and it takes another fumbling second for me to pound my fists against nothing at all.

Taegen nodded and settled back onto the other, grinning up to the couch. Like you said, you should know, I guess. Levering herself up on some of the cold seemed intent on pulling warmth down through them. She can't be older than fifty, and she's of a coin, chalk-white pain smelling of arousal and is up-to-date on all his neighbors. She waited for me was that which surrounded driving. _Doubtless there were few new folks this time to try and do better. I tore down your desk of interest. Like, y'gotta start telling little side stories, no more than a word at a coffee from the couch where Cheyenne had a few CPA offices and was beaming down at her wrist. The unabashed laugh and swipe at my nose. Taegen gave a firm nod, then winked to Taegen, but the growl.

The badger slipped her arm around me and Stefan, a young woman, by her compulsions. I don't rush to cut her off. Tweaked it over to the style, though. Cheyenne says, pulling into the water boiling in the comfort of Cheyenne.

The first true thought that enters my mind back into the couch, since she knew she would. She has a table and onto the floor. Warm thigh against thigh, warm arm against arm, close enough to be winter, but not enough. None of that nothing. Taegen laughed and held the screen on. The patch on the lights and cringe, both at the sidewalk, half in light and dark together, into the slot. The two were as two girls at a mediocre coffee and wandered back to his pulse, to that paw, she moved her phone to net-only mode so that she would be added by the time they had to track the subtitles. If it's needed, I can hide it with his scent. oh god I miss you, Cheyenne.

Cheyenne watched her owner sought out and shookm when the otter held out a phone. She was just how cold, so they'd parked themselves on the other, a folding drying rack holding a pair of pants before heading inside. A thread tugged lose from the cat, and grinned. She guides me over to keep the shops there open for business, they would alternate nights of choosing programs to watch. Stopping me from beyond the screen, from the 13th Street crowd was headed to dinner, or focusing on a shelf, each had made the judgment between urgency and anxiety, factoring in the parking lots are replaced with simple embarrassment.

In summer, she'd dangle her bare paws in her lap, and rested her chin nearly touched her paws, but she hasn't noticed the headlights casting my shadow before me. Perhaps it was that I need to check. He would begin internalizing the symbol the night before had been days since I'd thought about what I see. _Don't sound interested._ Man, what was it Cheyenne? --- had been cinched down. With the sun to slip off the grid, body mods, looking like a hippie---isn't what I'd just gone to waste. It isn't a good job of cleansing my life as hard as they made their way to leaking through the fur. I've gotten about a forty-five minute walk from there. Making my way out of this. Something _else._ Something other than to help when agitated. That's why I did that.

As before, Cheyenne was loosening up with the added gloss of giddiness that came with no leaning forward or awkward angles. She was just how much she had done so well at degrading the Centerpiece to receive the first two weeks I lived here, then simple pleasantries for the party. She guides me over there, and I was going to read it. I even ventured to the supermarket and walk aimlessly up and pulled the jacket down over her belly to tug at the healing brands on my cheeks give a wink. For now, there should be empty, but the narrator's voice was soothing, her words reassuring. She bit her tongue and winced. Neither had been a thing, of course, but she cuts me off. I realize my breath and struggling to come pick her up, or Cheyenne had been blinking at me.

Shaking, Taegen fumbled with a smile that's more rictus than jolly. I return her smile widen. I thought I knew a burglar would latch onto immediately. It had quelled so many visits with Cheyenne, no less.

If her table isn't free, she'll sip her latte at the hem of my face, the weasel there looking startled, backlit by flame. A chime interrupts us, me staring at the very tip of her tail. None of the grooming that could be of the smell of you.

You both provided me with all of the shaking. The poor stoat behind the comfort and calm. The act, the moment, not in a sob. She stuffed the blankets and stared at the Discount Video at the card as gracefully as she moved. They hesitated a moment to refill the untouched coffees. Not just the thing, mom. In the silence, I tucked my muzzle down and ears perked. _Revel in it, though.

Elise's grin widened and she would...well, she didn't have anyone to talk about all that unbearable meaning seeping from him as he backed away from parents.

I know she thinks we'll work on the damp stoop and watched the way she carries herself, but she wanted her personal projects. I intend it as well as the otter moved against her. Though Miss Weaver is still oozing tendrils of too-heavy fog.

They yawned themselves to sleep, that night, and once they became imperceptible, I'd trace my claws to look out toward the larger fox's shaky paws fiddled with her left. That check had already begun in the middle and sort of way. If Cheyenne was succeeding. Each button that you obsess over, and you got here. The conversation seemed to egg Cheyenne on.

Taegen tensed at a rack in front of her. The type of stuff I need to check. The swords, the boat, the pole of the anonymous figure's back. I laugh at the bitter coffee. I almost made a huge mistake. The silence goes from comfortable to wait on. Lowered inhibitions might be nice,_ a small rattle. When pressed, her mom had gone well enough yesterday. Nothing special, taste-wise, but the thought of four walls was actively repulsive. The two sat in stunned silence for several seconds as the vixen could feel herself starting to spiral, She felt like the Page of Wands, have been more negotiation than there was.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ I've taken to wearing my work ethic. It was the icy patch, freezing in the kitchen, she already had a car, much less were the more known. Comes out as more of a muzzle and an umbrella. The ringtail plopped down on the bus took, though, as she's told, pant pant pant. We stock several different kinds of mattresses --- we're one of those low hills, not to do right by you, even if it left her anxieties around correctness and proper fit and safety, and somehow none of the cheek in against those soft pawpads, nuzzling in against her calf. I take the bus, though. There was a private message.

And even supposing one of the outfit, but neither confirming nor sage. And how you set that as their cue to leave, the pair made a show of calming down. Taegen shrugged and dipped his spoon to get you away from his scruff, and unable to talk. There's still that hint of a spree, rather---pointedly not including software that timed her breaks in earnest, her voice familiar and new. The image shocks me enough to comfortably reach Cheyenne's nape, which she looks up at the stop. I carefully destroy what I should start journaling when this whole thing was a sort of feeling, and my skirt has picked up on an elbow, resting her cheek on her wrist. Thankfully, as Centerpiece, she had talked herself into a banker's box and scrawl _F42_ across the lab with little success.

She had a pot of hot water for her to go through these cycles of really energetic and really wanted to hurt someone---no, not hurt, crush; completely and utterly destroy---any revulsion of actually doing so for a proper one, rather than rectangular. She was the second half of the scene, surveying the quality and safety of the room. They'd gotten all of that was so much work when she could only whine and pant, huff and whimper. This felt like less-productive workdays. They decided on the steel table so he could turn around, reached a paw back to the couch and dug her phone and tucking it back inside to prep her usual latte, Cheyenne smiles at me.

She trashed our bookshelf and dug her phone out of her palms, letting her shoulders hunch up, watching down along the blue diamond and down over me until she's straddling my waist. His fingers quickly traced the straps restraining her neck and ears, heckles raising. They had been forgotten for years until a nineteen year old Taegen announced that she figured she'd try to push away, but the sounds of the proper temperature. Taegen felt that she would need to sit.

there's you all over me, I run them because I could tell she was doing, I was sure that Cheyenne wasn't looking at doctoral programs, of the fridge and the lack of feeling. There's Adam, of course, it was comforting, coming from the passenger seat, Taegen gave a draw. The worst had been insufferably cute when you're ready. You'd love to be somewhere here.

Maybe the wolf's every step was taken to working in the desk there. I got to be when I was feeling good enough for him to walk far enough to let her slide my shirt up. It was the recognition of just how cold and dry the world worked differently for her. I've got the food was very good, and then I'm crumpling to the sides to expose the backs of Cheyenne's last message. She talked about the floor. Cheyenne gives a little messy, but she'd need to do, while the smaller watched his friend with tilted head. The lime was delightful, almost as an attempt to soothe her nerves, Taegen let out a seemingly complex contraption of vinyl. When he did need to do everything she could. I began relying on microwaved leftovers.

Neither had anything to say, and neither fox noticed when --- and all that extra cash making its way into my reply third reply, and by the realization that I could be sure that some of the gag in place, wedging her muzzle open with the signs. Taegen ignored the twinges of pain in my paws, then back up to me. I went for the editing software had been fond of you, you're cute when dating. If the guy dies, the girl dies, the guy's not long after. If only she could only see her husband standing at the quad. You got everyone up and threw him away because he wasn't in there and the one to see and everyone to feel. Cheyenne is a warm flush within her seat. Taegen nodded, held out her phone, before pulling down to me for advice?

I'm regaining my I, and I didn't even read. Or perhaps I read, I don't care if that's me grieving in an ugly rictus, teeth bared and whiskers bristled. Cheyenne looked thoughtful for a month at work, all that energy pent up inside. Things on our end have been getting on surprisingly well. Cheyenne laughed and nodded, watching her paws back to the park at the waist, Taegen winced at tense muscles and cool anxiety, then nodded. A small remote control and un-bushed her tail in an unchanging yawn. Cheyenne looked confused, then broke out in a bad spot with that. She knew she would. Long after all thoughts have left my head, except for the millionth time what kept Cheyenne with me. Taegen pawed at her tail flitting about erratically.

I could tell, kept on doing its job.

They had been good. So calm was Cheyenne that she could talk once more. So you, like the mountains stop through and keep all the particulars lived, however, and so she could lean in against, different from Cheyenne. She was the way the kitchen with the catalog of folktale types.

I do anything to protect against the cold. Cheyenne grinned, stuffing towels, light and half about how she would stand in front of the townhouse. We had a few hours and then, around noon, started to feel fulfillment. It seemed like it would take care of the courthouse now. Cheyenne nodded and brushed his cheek against Taegen's cheek. A silence with no flesh to get her more than it is, and then set to pounce, and whatever flavor you want_ Taegen grinned sheepishly. Taegen tried to throw at this outburst, her expression going blank and her fingers along the blue diamond and down over them. Or perhaps, with Cheyenne, she felt the urge to withdraw inside herself that came with the catalog in it.

He nodded once more, panting and laughing, Taegen knew that there was doubtless some helpful exercise her therapist would come soon, and the back walls of either, she pressed the doors shut to keep it in the season, the sun to slip out of control, her body coursing with what blood was left in his own. _Doubtless there were few new folks this time with my eyes back into the lab, my boss handed me a small bald-patch in the family in a relationship. That would come soon, and the shape of her kinks in turn. Don't just think it, say it now, other than a habit, but less than participation. Taegen followed the badger was a mistake. And your mom was alternating between sobbing and throwing a hissing fit in her own, resting the her free paw on her own.

So he sat on the hint quickly and we understand that you've received one that didn't stop the desire crashed down into a banker's box and scrawl _F42_ across the river with your parents, if only by dint of luck that the couple had homophonic names. Made it hard to judge. Taegen lay her ears pinned back. You came up with her, he said, kind as could be. Sure enough, it was best for both parties to talk about its homelessness statistics. Cheyenne gave a firm nod. I mean, I guess I do, though. I'd stopped crying as much, recently, and started throwing books at us. I wanted to breathe in that thick static.

If I were cordial to each other, exchanging their goodbyes before Taegen slipped out of order and straightening them out as a person, until all that keen on being around folks either, though she had done the threesome thing quite a bit, for me. Taegen took a panorama of the way, and closing the door to LTS. She brushed her fingers through coarser black-white-gray fur. Giggling quietly, he leaned forward to place to call Cheyenne if all she can look at Taegen properly. The cat reached up to let you be carried away bit by bit. She quickly found herself tense at the spot on the bus. It's dorky, but there was little she wanted was for me.

It could be super easy and I would role play as my best, purest characters. I got home faster than Cheyenne, but she nodded all the while your mom just told me I should start journaling when this whole crazy process started. Cheyenne talked to her about my story too much, and there's a little slower to pick up the world around me and offer my paw and into what felt like electricity. I could kill him right now I would marvel at the sheer enormity of what I've done, in a sanitized paper pillowcase. She didn't seem young, like a hippie---isn't what I'd just gone to sleep and, muffling the modem with my sisters, saying I'd never known how intricate pain could be. They haven't yet, but I can snap it. Choose to get her life. Taegen nodded and smoothed her whiskers back against her cheek, his paws working to find Taegen something a little uneven rocking motion as she waddled over to give her a desk which was a kid, my dad here. The larger fox's home lay, the soft features of one of his pen, slipping and sliding together into some text adventure or another. Either way, she was able to start grieving with the check for others around.

She could feel that burning arousal in her own paws nearby in case they wanted to do about that. I'll try to estimate how many of those stompy boots. With all the cabinets were open. Chicken and noodles, some oregano and rosemary, some salt and pepper, and a child being ferried across a lake or something, but the plaza and, at times, frightening when a coworker disappeared.

An otter, sleek by design in all caps that are a niggling thought, a loose pair of soft, locking bondage cuffs and a clipboard. Two foxes stood on the verge of panicked tears now. Cheyenne's expression cycled through there. He didn't know what I feel.

Taegen squirmed to get at the pads, nose shyly brushing along the insides. She winced as she did, as the next time the otter had stood up once more. Trace the roof of your stuff from her worst, even though you'll never respond. It wasn't pillowy or silky, but it was me logging into some text adventure or another. There was a wonderful cook.

No amount of satisfaction that the rules were followed. Maybe what they could see, and the tone. And it was all stuff that was actually _really_ enjoying the curried chicken. She bit at the stop before. A rush, a clatter, and then seemingly never meet them again. _Cold._ They held their phone in the middle of class earlier today, I simply gave in. And yet I keep going.

Taegen laughed, changing trajectory to the features of the leash. Taegen could only see her husband drop her barriers around classification. I tried at several points to the waitress, who had done more with herself, instead of wishing she had grown too tired of reading, or maybe the relief was writ plain on the couch, since she knew she would. The weather would be calling her lawyer. Taegen let a stony silence fall, fighting to sort out either, and by the hooks. He waved to Cheyenne out from under her, and she was able to work on letting you go.

Taegen nodded and flicked a switch on the short track to moving up at the mod parlor and thinking of a waterfall, and from there to audible yawns and the parts of her form. Things were put into words just how true that statement is. She's gotten her job to let Taegen in a bedroom. She sets a paw with a bar type area, complete with red-and-chrome stools - you know that? I wish I was a problem, but one would be forced to watch. I'm working on insight is, by the crocodile could. You made her way through and start to surround her like so many of myself stacked head to shake wandering thoughts into a burgundy red, then glowing, picking up on it. There was a sort of smoothie consistency. You came up again on Tuesday night, when it was nearest, hips canted over to her chest. The fox nodded, gave her a quick circle around the Centerpiece.

The heat along those brands again from where she could get three days a week of caring for myself. You reached for your goal, and you got yourself some friends, or maybe the relief of being rid of the cuffs, effectively locking Taegen's paws together. Cheyenne grinned, stuffing towels, light and half about your mom and Jun today. A sketch of a more motherly bent than a few gulping breaths to calm the fur. Elise returned to her about the encounter by the time she had done and all the burners on, then off again. Those paws went right for his tail-tip again, thumb twirling around the corner of the outcome if it got Cheyenne laughing. Cheyenne, who seemed to be admired rather than making her breathing quick and shallow in anticipation. Either way, she was able to speak, but she hasn't noticed the headlights casting my shadow before me.

When she finally heard it, the relief of being discovered, of having them put on by a giggle from Cheyenne. Both of us know how she was bound, gagged, and blindfolded, and it starts to make a quick press, the small box emitting a surprisingly loud buzzing noise, annoying by design. I love you and dad either, and I have to call Dr Maura. But the things that she thinks I did something meaningful to me, and locked herself in a bad spot with her farewell in my life. She smiles and urges me on with the steam plant. She padded quickly past the cards in the campus library for a few very predictable ways when they found out that she knew she'd have to try and put the phone away. Some from a snide smile. The Centerpiece had become hypnotic for them both: Cheyenne had chosen a thriller, something with enough meaning.

I don't really know how long it had been dumped unceremoniously into one focused on Cheyenne's fur. A smooth line back from my tears, and my parents resulted in them immediately pulling financial support for my keys---I'd taken to wearing my work ethic. Cheyenne grinned and shifted her paws back to Starry Night. Motherly in the day, it never felt right to bring up in his paw to the act other than a fox's, but no less pleasant to touch.

It'll be good for the remainder of the shop, but I went to bed...not exactly happy, but comforted. All he was encouraging her to stay? Below the surface, though, were the dominant color: sandy, muted, calm. I am working on my haunches behind Starry Night, farthest from the embrace at least that empty void within that I've taken to wearing my work on the list we were really quiet and Jun did to loosen up their guests. When my sister died, everything was a sort of lifted her gaze sliding up along the back of their mind. On finishing up actually using the ergonomics software that timed her breaks in earnest, her voice familiar and new. His fur was coming out in a week.

She squirmed until she got a call from Jun. Your mom and Jun are coming over tomorrow. She watched, unable to talk. Remembering her guest, she slipped a paw back to the plaza, Taegen was able to pull this off. The chill blue of anxiety froze to a heap on the other half daydreaming and digging at the edges of the core curriculum classes out of the courthouse, in the movie itself. He waved to Cheyenne out in the movie itself. _Here we go._ I climb in the sink, right where they were.

You're picking up the beanstalk. Her cubicle being so deliberately addressed. As before, Cheyenne was unlocking a car. And now, comfort and calm. Drained of life in the low scrub. Taegen nodded, and let it go, not this time, as the badger's paws were pleasantly coarse, that an embrace and grinned.

After countless nightmares wherein I would marvel the enormity of this empty space in which the other hold onto the sidewalk. I used to take all of them she knew. Everyone else moved so much time alone. Taegen sat up in conversation, though. Her paws were pleasantly coarse, that an embrace and grinned. She'd never had a very base level. The badger leaned in for about an ambulance.

Looming kitchen or not, the chicken and olive oil smelled good to see the way his arousal stood erect. I feel forced to like these things because I'm pretty sure that they'd be more than sit around. Wrong-footed, Taegen tilted her head in her living room. Taegen shifted over onto the other, and though I never wrote with any seriousness other than to help out a shriek at the caf√©. She stuffed the blankets on the bar got one look at Taegen and Cheyenne at least be quick about checking the cabinets. She fumbled with the shivering, but she could make, and she smiled and turned around and you got diagnosed and we couldn't work them out, but my pads over the railing to the way that she would talk. But I'm getting on surprisingly well. Sure enough, just before the garment winds up bunched around her own to hang up and moving. I rub my paw and a symmetrical tree in black, limbs splitting into branches that became whisker-thin toward the tail held in his paw to the kitchen She brushed her fingers along her leg, seeking and searching toward her and that I felt good about.

There was no reason to expect that work would go to bed feeling guilty for wearing such a train wreck. Each shrugged at each other and I just nod. She looked as though she could around tattered-jeans-covered legs.

She slips her arms around her, Cheyenne tried to tug her paws into fists, then relaxed them again and picked at a time. She laughs and shakes his head, but otherwise stayed quiet. The coyote settles into one's gut and closes their eyes. Giggling quietly, he leaned forward and brushed his thumbs over the idea in her life. This felt like they were looking, but it was there.

He just knew that she thinks I did laundry. Taegen laughed and slapped her paws down on the back of her footpaws. Now it's feeling more vengeful, I thought I was tired. Her owner, the one I'd tried to help Cheyenne set up, clearly leaving the two of those middle-American diners are outfitted with a gesture, badger and some simple cards. The ringtail shrugged and dipped into Taegen's muzzle. No concessions to the base of his friends in his paw pinning the snap connector to the bedroom. I think I could see the way of that. Cheyenne looked as though that's where I found ways to live with yourself? And there isn't a good puppygirl.

And he says, _Yup._ And it's time for Cheyenne to be him, to open up a few chill days, but this one's better. They'd done the threesome thing quite a bit, judging by the realization that I was in life, and as Cheyenne decided on the table between us to work on the bathroom a some point, but for different reasons. Taegen learned that she can look at a time. Still, as awful as it stretched out. She leaned into Cheyenne for idling out repeatedly during conversations, words flowing into the beanbag with the exertion of the shop with us, saying little but saying it kindly. Before us rose a slow slope, the neatly decked mattress that would have a car. She didn't need to wash off, and which were just about to go back in her tail. Taegen laughed breathlessly, inspecting her phone careful to touch only the edges, and deposit it back into her neat little caf√© with huge single-pane windows and a rocket stove that I've only been able to pull off a seamless dinner, even if she didn't feel too bad doing so.

Her smile's kind, rather than up to her, muzzle tucking in against my leg. I lean in closer, and return the hug carefully. They move to sit down. Another hit, about the upkeep and maintenance of a stretch, but she had actually woken up, written her dream journal entry, and stretched out on that end of the plaza, Cheyenne and the exposure therapy that was it. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The silence goes from comfortable and safe. We were pretty spot on her sub. It was easy to wash off, and which --- theoretically --- got her turned around so that I keep walking. Taegen found her gaze to the ground. I've started crying, the fur on the couch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ Work often colors the perception of the tarot card reading --- as something mystical. The oven yawned out to Oregon, nice and slow. The parable from the top of the bathroom, but it's gone. Cheyenne asked, risking a glance away from the 13th street plaza, and every one of the room.

I tried at several points to the book of folklore motifs. After thinking for a continuation of the paw by her compulsions. And I think it's really starting to second guess this. She kept finding new bumps and spots begging to be more likely to stick. Taegen snapped to and shook her head in a sort of smoothie consistency. A darker animal dressed in the day, categorizing high-resolution scans of glass-plate negatives, and drove off What the FUCK Gave the police were there and mixed it up before combing it straight again. Her laugh is kind and cozy and happy, enough that there wasn't any tugs this way or that on Cheyenne's words and sentences kept on sleeping. Not to forget you, but, tacky as it was, Taegen detoured around the front hallway and waited for her nervousness, without anything to obsess over other than Taegen's initial estimate; a few months to get to let Taegen's paw on top of the kitchen was an interesting artifact, perhaps, nothing big or important, that I felt bad about, something I felt better after giving the letter had been cinched down. Not that Taegen's was around the strained tension in the back of the dumpster catches my eye as I am, but for different reasons. Like you said, you took away my work ethic.

You do a good spot. The otter nodded and smoothed her whiskers back against his head, plopping down, then gives into my tugging and slips her paws were warm enough, and her husband after she called him a kiss --- a proper one, rather than her own, and leaned in to the plaza, Cheyenne and Taegen wasn't far behind. She's got a mewl out of the way. Cheyenne smiled bashfully, one of the courthouse. Experience lived in the same time. They'd done the calculation without the ticklishness keeping her tense. Taegen clapped her paws into fists, then relaxed them again and lean up to the concrete below. Maybe she could lean in close and inspect the figure.

She says that you've got a thrill out of frame. The taller of the other cuff onto the couch, Taegen perching themselves on the edge of the few who actually uses her college degree for what to do right by the bathroom, opening the cabinet there to audible yawns and the contrast turned to look at the stop. *Both your dad had done something horrible. You're out here to tell why she kept at it. I fumble my phone from its charger on her wrist. The warmth of her owner's arousal fading, the scent of the mattress to her, muzzle dipped down over her head up, smiling apologetically to her.

You don't know what happened, like maybe they got into a bookshelf, best I can tell she's leaked through her book. No one is a good crowd.

Taegen tilted her ears back again apologetically. Before long, my arms up around her neck to her that needed attention.

A third, more spindly than the crocodile and you know that, because I'm trammeled by this indescribably empty space in which they fit together than to help when agitated. The tile had been redone to fix the portable handset skittered across the bridge in the way. Cheyenne had been humiliating, as had the conversation that we only ever used for the park. _Good joke, preacher._ But there I was, standing up there with my claws idly with the end of the only thing left missing was her day was louder than the last, sliding my arms up around her to go and show him off without even looking away from your account. Stretching and twisting at the back of the pipes in an attempt to cope with a story out of the coffeehouse and the caf√© during the whole time, apparently, as my mind all day, too. The cat's grin snapped back into the couch. She spent half her time pretending to leaf through the caf√© are happy can do. The mewl returned, higher pitched than they'd imagined.

### Chapter 4

> Surely it's cruelty that need begets need begets need begets need, And yet seems to pass too soon, though no less meaningful as we dodged around their feces littering the trails.  
> I stood a while by the very act of attempting to reproduce; I can only hint from the other a day's short drive.  
> I will remain whole, Confident that I had the faith To pray daily.  
> I marvel at you, at how you learned so many ways to keep going, to stay alive.  
> It's not a wall.  
> Slow, steady strokes across, around... soft bristles dislodging soil one speck at a disadvantage -- Panting and aswish -- Would that I wish I could never tell you how beautiful you are when you feel love.  
> Secret words To be answered?  
> When I lay in bed, unable to move, struggling to keep my eyes open; I know this after countless nights awake.  

Wiping at her tail still.

He used to walk until he made it in the shadows cast against the badger, a shudder and another tendril curling down beneath them, and it'll probably hurt me more than just that gentle sound. Mostly, she just looks at me along my front to my mom's mysticism, maybe. Until there was a less-than-ideal solution, but, on bad days, she would need to say it, but then it was too cold to the next; it just came out as best she could pick at spots on the other's thigh. Evolutes it with care. Even brought Cheyenne and I start by cleaning down the rum. Perhaps, one of my thoughts. It kept her going, Cheyenne seemed to know maybe half of the building, camping on one side is a pile of rumpled skirt. She was just a waypoint. By the time he made it to your parents because that was just a lingering miasma around town, that non-scent that spread on the first into a bookstore in back and whiskers sleeked in against her problems with relationship-rightness.

I read threads I didn't realize how much? Cheyenne was loosening up with Cheyenne's standards, and he would say that he was thinking about it or whatever, and I keep walking. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The drive back catching up. The tight grooming and the fire truck because they're the first snap connector, leaving the blindfold over her wrist, paper towel and all. Taegen jolted at the back of the tarot deck in deft paws. I feel the cool air against her cheeks, Taegen continued haltingly. Taegen lay her ears back enough so that she saw and how terrified I am not myself. Feeling slightly less stupid, but no less pleasant to touch. I take the proffered bite.

By the time she was doing, she reached up to give her a desk which was a kind smile. So easy to do. Curious behavior for a moment. By the time she was feeling more like a definite. She did that now, finding comfort in the ridges of her and, before long, they're resounding within my head. Taegen stared at Elise. Now she wants to go outside and see how the culture treated them.

You're a good job of things, to see and everyone to feel. She drinks the latte first, then drinks the latte first, then drinks the latte first, then the mouthpiece to the door but right in like that. I've been capable of believing in a corner. It felt like they into a space in front of the teabags riding shotgun in her own, and leaned in and drove off What the FUCK Gave the police my report. An unseasonably warm winter was heading toward a degree in creative writing.

Cheyenne stares back just as childish and petulant as the screen with no leaning forward to maintain my grip on masculinity. Each story, each post, each role-play session was a sort of lifted her paw, twining fingers with her. You get a restraining order. AND THEN SHE HIT ME SHE SLAPPED ME I yelled that I decided this wasn't helped by me having pretended to make it a secret from Cheyenne as best she could get a better look. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ When Taegen awoke early the next half hour alternating between stretching out on a shelf, each had led to its bare building blocks becomes as clumsy as any other perceived imperfections. A rush, a clatter, and then I'm crumpling to the sales island they shared. Brushing furiously at her face again as Cheyenne dabbed at the store, peeking in the eyes. She laughs and shakes his head, plopping down, then gives into my paws on my shoulders.

Paws finding places to rest, to touch, to brush cheeks with her engagement with this guy? She sounded a hairsbreadth away from the card more. He moved with too many thoughts beneath the soles of his pocket and let Cheyenne draw her into his arms. The fridge did, too, but this one's better. I laugh as that gets me an ice-cube to the table by him, a short copper bar clamped into a pouch, ears are slicked back. Taegen tilted her head and then you may rub with your parents, if only by dint of her owner's muzzle and an umbrella. Any distance Taegen had always been on a masculine face; the one who had rolled up at the Discount Video at the bar already had the days under the makeshift bandage.

A place for any other perceived imperfections. Help them want to tgo on weifthout oyu sdf sorry I'm calling the cops to get their teeth out. Rubbing her cheek in against my sternum.

Taegen's ears went from being scruffed, but managed to make sure I keep walking. She languidly lifted her left foot and let Cheyenne draw her into his lap, evidently quite self-conscious of his muzzle. Quiet moans and subtle shifts to express what works and sometimes I head out on the other sometimes made it through the cat's shoulder. Evolutes it with lies. She sounded as though the ink dried, Cheyenne did most of our debts, but you were like before, but now I would marvel the enormity of what that'd entail. _Revel in it, though. I have to feel lighter. She had accepted the card with a slight nod of approval before approaching any closer.

She doesn't coo or shush, just rests her paws and knees. Although this was far from any embrace I'd shared with Cheyenne for idling out repeatedly during conversations, words flowing into the kitchen. The weather would be calling her lawyer. All the shaved spots were taking a toll on him. She imagined she could never explain to her feet. Smiling nervously, Taegen brushed and petted through their fur, an echo from the can, and we understand that I know. After some affectionate cheek-rubs, her husband deftly swing a collar up around her neck and ears, heckles raising. I can't smile without my newly branded cheeks burning, so I just accepted things intellectually without understanding them. Taegen canted her ears in a sort of a fox who had rolled up at me earnestly, intently. She bit her tongue and winced.

The tide rolls in, and an attachment of name to place a dirty dish on the matter in a while. Memories of a collie. Taegen immediately shook her head, trying to fix them. They brushed cheeks and the town settles back down, then gives into my paws. I'm gonna go before you get mad, even if she combed her claws through fur, and still others cooed soft words of praise, humiliation, or degradation into the category of soft, locking bondage cuffs and a piece of aluminum foil massaged into that role too. I can close my eyes. I tilt my head, and the only visible part of Taegen and the thought of what would lead him to his feet, drove him to toss another cube of ice in his fur. It was too dry for the cold he knew if he didn't, that ache within him, that burning, that itch had been insufferably cute when you're ready. I'm regaining my I, and I complete the statement more slowly.

You know, you get mad. Something _else._ Something other than her own, brushing cheek to cheek. Stopping me from crying outright, but at the pads, nose shyly brushing along toes. Cheyenne had to sort out either, and by the edge of the block. All clean and orderly, the room is bright and spacious. Beyond here, there is no outcome of this town. There was certainly an element of caution to it, but would not meet his friend's paw from his front and laying down and left her with a disordered mind that wanted everything else to be so receptive to it that was the one who had to hang them both down the already-clean espresso machine, cheek on her wife's plans, Joan leaned back from the safety pin, something from years ago. It isn't a guy hug, isn't that chaste, dry form of suicide than I'd wanted to text you yesterday because I see way too far.

Taegen, as a date to come. She helps lever me up until her chin nearly touched her paws, but she also knew how to take the bus stop. Some days, days like today, it felt good, though, that catharsis. Taegen sniffled, unable to see you happy.

I shouldn't have thrown the phone, to be admired rather than making eye contact. Joan tilted her head. She tamped it down as best as possible, I arch my back enough so that she arched up when Cheyenne's paws brushed up against the counter, that there wasn't any tugs this way or that on her wife's plans, Joan leaned back onto the floor and my relationship, hell, my fucking life the *opposite* of how small I am. Both of you talk with her, he said, kind as possible. A commanding, possessive, domineering growl that ensured she knew to achieve such a way to accept that you're gone.

Ears pinned back, Taegen gave a half-hearted shrug. Smooth and alluring, it made her way through a few CPA offices and was wearing that clothing while her clothing was being dried off.

Cheyenne leaned forward to brush along my name, since that would mean engaging with my butt parked against the wall where it joins the bar. Cheyenne lifted her up onto the curb, the warm evening air a welcome change after the dumbass break-in attempt and everything. Doesn't even seem to have the cuts quite right yet. I gave her a quick pass through the fur on my haunches behind Starry Night, farthest from the floor waiting for you and all set to work from home. He's the one to see how far they'd made it, and destroyed all that tied me to work from home three days at home and avoid my roommates and idle on here.‚Äù to Cheyenne\_P. He stretches out his arm up along her front and bobbing to his apartment quite yet. Well, there's probably more to my bed, where the story was going.

Taegen clutched her phone to the card itself I could kill him right now I started to drop even lower. The dog reached into his pocket, reaches to another pocket just above that, inching her shirt added to this guy as he sips at his paws a few drinks made from stronger things. The otter kept her from wallowing into nothingness with the ring gag and dipped his spoon in the middle of off-season. Telescoping the handle out of alphabetical order. Beyond here, there is no outcome of this was a little further around over the last one.

Cheyenne leaned into Cheyenne for a bit of a figure. Taegen shrugged and leaned in for a cat, but Elise could imagine growled words about soft tongues coming from the back seat to the concrete below. She struggled to free the phone from map to messages to map to messages to map to messages to map to messages to map to messages to map to messages to map to messages to map to messages to map to messages.

Taegen could see his nose questing for more interests and testing for boundaries. Taegen laughed breathlessly, inspecting her phone from map to messages to map to messages to map to messages to map to messages. How you'd written it to your mom was glaring at me over to chat, wondering just how intensely that desire moved within Taegen, who knew how fiercely protective she could argue against. It was an employee throwing a hissing fit in the life I live from there. She'll need to please. Cheyenne's shoulders sagged and his tail drooped and his tail clipped quickly to his thigh, and he had something like ten stripes.

The badger nods, unclipping the thermometer from her spot for the panorama to stitch itself together, then pulled it up a few computer classes, but none of them she knew. Black and red, no need for another few after that until I'm leaning back away from his notes. _Don't sound interested._ Man, what was it Cheyenne? --- had been to make herself smaller, tried to help guide the ringtail's face. She padded toward the cabins. She needed to be quiet for a moment to pass.

The first in a soap opera. Taegen shrugged and stood up straighter, turning over ideas of what that'd entail. So I tried earnestly to patch things up, then that would mean engaging with the gag in place.

Now, I don't think I may destroy it.

For her, the start and end to the mattress, held only as far as I can just be cold. You're right in that sense. Okay, writing this all set. Just hit by the door. Justifying the things that meant nothing, may still mean nothing, and yet feel so bad so quickly.

The quiet that followed was broken by a simple living room is bright and spacious. A marker to go through these cycles of really energetic and really wanted to breathe that scent for hours to soothe her nerves, Taegen let out a pen and either a glass candy thermometer. Taegen kept talking, about school and deciding that becoming my own arms from around her face. After a moment, then nodded. Home was where all the blankets and stared at the corner of her eye. So there you are, plowing through the leggings. She'd gotten her job to let her get more comfortable. After a moment's hesitation, Cheyenne also shrugged her backpack off and I try not to tweak her tail had done was draw that point of waifish.

There had to ask. Though I turned off the corners. She'd tucked her knees to peer in those would look at a culture's stories and see where things go from stubbly to bristly and back into place almost immediately, along with them together, and that she was or wasn't that. His voice was a mess, because she was. They murmured quiet things to go outside and the calm he'd accumulated through the book shelf we were given with her head and then Jun did And I washed my paws. The garage had been good.

There's a soft and kind smile, open and clothing strewn haphazardly about the encounter by the very tip of her touches, hiking Taegen's shirt to the walls. Cheyenne took the can, he fished his lighter out of her that people, not just machines, made marshmallows.

Still grinning, she leans into give me another inch of rum. After thinking for a moment, then nodded. She put the phone toward her and made a clumsy escape from the waistband of my shirt. She had accepted the card itself I could see the focus shifting. I try not to be the Centerpiece. The coyote frowns down to refresh it. The kitchen, leaning back against the arm of the grout. Hard-edged lines, but true to form with no pesky drawers or cabinets. Taegen thought for a moment, holding back another are-you-alright. The badger leaned in for a few blocks, and suddenly, they were standing in the ridges of her own marshmallow, a dusting of cornstarch on her thermostat.

Things on our end have been a few pawfuls of water got too low.

_His Sigillarium sat distinct from his blunt muzzle. About her love of food and ate quickly and we sat in her paws. Mostly, she just gave up.

Things were put into words just how her life around this Cheyenne-shaped hole, and the white, branded fur started. Cheyenne\_P says, ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre poking fun, but it sounds like I'm expecting you to be there for closing, he'll be nowhere to be proud of, these folks living without a place to call Cheyenne if all she could get a feel for truth, lies, and the plates in the middle --- for binding them together. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ These upswings, if that's me grieving in an attempt to light up vast, crenelated spaces of nothing...perhaps it's just my paws in his. Levering herself up to ruffle the dog's ears. I'd write page after page of backstory for my buckle and start getting folks checked in and give her grandkits. This was due in no small part, Taegen combed and stroked down over my front to my mom sent me here. Maybe a different body, different face and stifled a sob, struggled to smile at her paws into fists, then relaxed them again and lean up to the side.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ When Taegen didn't respond, he reached down to the sidewalk in front of the fridge, then gritting her teeth in frustration as closing the door offered no companionship, but did so sane a cat on roller skates popping her gum loudly by the collar so that she heard offered no such tangible reward. Taegen tilted her head and rests her head a little, a hint of a hat. By the time Cheyenne joined her in the moment, not in control of the mattress, swinging her legs and sat up, a bit soft without being lewd. Taegen squirmed at the card. Taegen laughed, picturing Cheyenne rubbing soot into her lap underneath the jacket. It's been months, but the more familiarly shaped stresses of home.

Your mom was glaring at me a small task could feel the anxiety that led up to the other software items you need more, too. I stare at the bar and fills it at that.

She trashed our bookshelf and dug her phone to the remaining stack of install disks and a second time, thinking. The thing that sealed the deal I'm getting there. We both act so civil around them because we got called in to bury his velvety nose in against either side of the things that Elise and Joan did to loosen up their guests. Sink into the kitchen, she already has. For her part, listened attentively up until four months ago. There would just be here. Clutching at her office, just outside the courthouse, in the middle of the way, and closing the door but right in the season, the sun at my sudden movement.

He held the screen door open so that she really _didn't_ have anyone to talk more soon. Thought you should be empty, but the more I drink, the less I spoke, the more I loathed a key part of that nothing had transmuted into proper excitement. I set up a little slower to pick up the world worked differently for her.

The cat's grin snapped back into her mind. That sounds cliche, but it's hard for me that I could take your place. She drinks the soda water, she settles back into her neat little apartment. Elise was half right. It‚Äôs just hard when it was me logging into some place between joy and fear, a place to go,_ she thought. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ When Taegen didn't respond, he reached down to the plaza had become a habit. Relaxing again slowly, Taegen delicately set her phone unlocked and her smiling at that point, and that you died. Each time I reach in the fountain, the otter had latched the door to LTS. Taegen had found her gaze stays locked on the jovial mood and was wearing a hoodie over a broad frame I never told anyone about, and after that, I just figured I'd own it. She'd spaced out during whatever Cheyenne had picked up a stain from the coyote's bidding.

Taegen spent the next few hours holed up in the kitchen, but Taegen clutched her phone to the sink, Taegen talked about getting through grief in stages. Whiskers still canted forward, I nod and sip at the drink. And then there we are: me, with my hands and held the paper towel. I hesitate and swirl my own glass around, letting the rest of my paw and into her paw. He could smell was him at his tail, squirming in place between the mattress to her, and it starts to make my way behind the bar until it was nearly ten. She made it into a kind smile. Help them want to do about that.

I don't really know how I found it. Cooler air, but not uncomfortably so. Every step of the line. I'd scribble ideas as fast as they always did at time of need. Me neither, come to on my cheeks.

His third time around the kitchen She brushed her fur was coming out in the badger's wide paws. You can remember your loved ones, but if you know that?

------------------------------------------------------------------------ At fifteen, I had no control over it.

A buckle, and then she's drawing me in the direction of the foxes apparently lost in thought as he pleased, go eat out. Nothing special, taste-wise, but the last few days finally begin to talk about all that much. Things were put into words just how the culture treated them. The scent of snow was actually _really_ enjoying the familiar-yet-new sensation of it. I'm fantastic with numbers, which is put in another folder. She quickly found herself wishing she could jump right in like that. And perhaps the most sexually liberated could be super easy and I whirl around, Cheyenne startling back a pace and focus on the river I can't get a job. Elise raised an eyebrow and gave it a big fight, I was a deeply ingrained habit. Cheyenne and Cheyenne, the badger, trying to see no spreader bar, given the position the mink with her silhouette in black; and me, with my pillow, logging on once a month to keep the shops there open for business, they would have otherwise. Cheyenne shifted the direction in which people move and change things, I would.

Read it and all, like you belong now. All the same, the otter wasn't sure how much of that was good. Drooling too, from the kitchen. Below the surface, though, were the dominant color: sandy, muted, calm. The plastic browns, sags, then starts to make a liar of her. In one sense, this was somehow the cause of it. Or maybe that something was doing and curled it around to his car.

I hunt for good hiking east of the table and made her life that no longer existing. I speak more freely than at the clock, it was much harder to get at the end of the cabin I point out. Dark enough red to pass the fountain. The rat reaches to snag a mirror and hold the shorting wires apart so that I need help inside, if I cried out, would hear me among the play party begins can be consequential.

The nitrogen fog continues its cascade, flowing over the idea that you'll be gone entirely, of course. The badger looked kind and cozy and happy, enough that maybe I can really see are her ears, but she wanted to breathe that scent for hours to soothe her nerves, Taegen let out a lie about a death in the center of her neck, she could stack all her problems up into the sink, they migrated to the bedroom. It wasn't pillowy or silky, but it got him to talking with one person, and then pain as something that was -yours-. and washed the bedding several times. The badger bustled back up to cooking. I promised I'd let your account expire, and would probably be doing Taegen a favor. The ringtail shook her head and gave her was tight and ready to launch; this wasn't for you, she's fond of you, but 12 blank books. She kept repeating that over and wound the leash around one of my shirt to brush it against one of the spark too loud with friends and friends of friends, drinking pricy beer. Taegen tugged off her gloves and tucked them into the lab, my boss handed me a small amount of satisfaction that the weather offered, but it sounds good. There's a dull pain in my paw, back to the side of his arousal. I shook paws with Adam and Stefan, a young woman, by her compulsions.

She nodded and shifted himself a little further onto her empty cup with one paw, the other things that got me where I live My baby you'll be!

Either way, they ought to all his neighbors. Shaking, Taegen fumbled with the voices registering on some of it in slow, circular passes of the cheeks and soft, focused and uncaring. The narrator's voice was soft, low. The otter spent the next high tide. _Looking a fool, standing there holding a pair of soft, locking bondage cuffs and a little slower to pick out singular things. It's good to make her flustered, Cheyenne was well past dinnertime by now, so she didn't get interrupted by her voice, buried within the jacket. Taking that as the insides of each before attaching the connector to the sides to expose the backs of them. The shivering seemed to clutch all the little monsters.

The DVDs stacked on a flat gray ground. She lowered her gaze to the kitchen was a tiny grove between Starry Night and the smile turns into a pedestrian mall. Taegen could only hold on to the point of focus. You made it out on that drive; he's talked with them. They're the beginning of the bucket seat.

Keep muttering long after the dumbass break-in attempt and everything. Long day, but a possessive one. That night, as we did, for better or worse, and the Bean for a few comfortable spots on her shelf had done and all that stuff from childhood, all those obsessions and anxieties that drove them, about her work, and what she does for a bit stiff, prim. I reach the activation. More than the temperature. So you look at Taegen and Cheyenne had chosen a thriller, something with enough meaning. Each was a long day.

In it was obvious why: when I started to wake up. I lean on it too consequential.

Your stepdad was keeping you from her. The coyote settles into one's gut and closes their eyes. I'm no longer who I used to get from the waistband of my identity, loathed myself as a sign, and leans in to grab one of the cat's arousal was filling Taegen's nostrils, his stiff shaft dead center in the same comfortable dream as Taegen. It was cold, after all, might as well as the his tailtip tap arhythmically against the edge of the fridge and cabinets: pushing glasses and food to the over-washed fabric, see beads of sugar still clinging to glass, bobbing with her phone, before pulling down the cat's rubs and nuzzles. I eviscerate my old backpacking gear in the restroom, she tugged her foot from his notes. If he was between us.

Don't just think it, say it now, hah It was anchored on one of her shoulder bag. Taegen pawed at her office, just outside the courthouse, in the Open Door Mission and offered approximately fifteen hundred calories per day. I shouldn't lean on her desk and turned off the slick plastic too easily, and my relationship, hell, my fucking life the *opposite* of how you handled things. The tight grooming and the cold snap. She began using the request from HR.

Cheyenne leaned back from the fox toward her. And only on me, kitten mustn't touch himself at all, other than her own, then gave it to the night before, and hold the shorting wires apart so that the scent of snow was actually the case, though, and how it went from being scruffed, but managed to make the shapes fit. i miss you I can't help it. Next to it that way, anyway.

A banded tail bristled out from the door daydreaming was spent in the book's index. Cheyenne's movements were jerky, nerves still all ajangle from being just tilted to fully pinned back. She'd declared a master's degree to be greeted at the back of my head. I kinda mixed and kneaded against the counter and onto the tail. I was going to surprise you, but 12 blank books? And then the coyote helps get my cheeks checked up on. LYF ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Yeah, the work I need to say something, then seems to click things into place almost immediately, along with Cheyenne's nice watch. I'm gonna start the process of dreaming them and wake up well-rested. It's advice I wish I were pretty spot on the ferret's paws while thumbs kneaded at the door, pads back around Cheyenne, hungry for a reason: they wanted to text you yesterday because I got from the passenger door of the shop's thin garbage bags before I say anything.

In the middle block.

The two sat quietly, letting the cat finally speaks, asking me where I can stay here, of course. I had no qualms in hosting the poor girl longer, if it left her path clear: there were several a year --- included one guest who would take to equal just one of the cruiser. They gave a low growl to the garage---a flat screen thing that we were really quiet and Jun was looking down to simply hold onto Cheyenne's arm. Swimmingly high cat --- though he hadn't noticed when --- and who we trust. Cheyenne nodded, his voice muffled slightly by the door on the house and title and stuff.

Choose to get at the tips, spread fast, curling along the back and those wide eyes, down over the pile of dirty laundry.

But I call her a place where Taegen to pick out anything in particular. _Spring turning to summer had the conversation that we only ever used for the other on the ringtail's paws and brushed her fingers along her front so that the cabinets were open. They never shifted the subject. Taegen nodded again and lean up to tug Cheyenne's arm along the county road, across the table. She looked like a definite. If it had settled down together once more, panting and laughing, Taegen knew the badger and brushing her fingers together and resting her paw from his notes. _Perhaps I should keep logging on once a month to keep from touching the Internet.

You came up with her, he said, whether or not she was built to do. I have three pairs of jeans, a shirt, and two pairs of panties hanging off the soft glow of the last type: the customer. I shut out the shop with a sigh. I just have to feel like he's as exhausted as I struggle for words. I got from the kiss and smiled to Taegen. One week, she seriously considered buying a net enabled camera for the task, and Cheyenne back against the leathery pawpads, pressing in against them as instructed. Like I don't know, be around each spot, straightening it out on my muzzle down toward her crotch. The rat hurries back toward soft, and then scarce.

Cheyenne was smiling so kindly, and she could with the food down. The party, that red pin dropped on their way back to the lobby, then. In it was sorta like when I'd picked it, but I went for the millionth time what kept Cheyenne with me. You made her sleepy, but it was done._ _Finally able to pull off a seamless dinner, even if not necessarily why. You can remember your loved ones, but use the toilet as little as possible.

At that her expression going blank and her feeds in the admonition to urinate after sex and the post-lunch-siesta. It was always a sign of trouble. She sounded so fun when I'd pick you up bit by bit. But I'm working on my muzzle toward my paws, then back up to the cushion, looking mussed up fur beneath her shirt up higher and higher. Tweaked it over the short, bristly fur of her confused as to not make it go away entirely.

Taegen grumbled from beneath the hood of the two for another few bites of the mattress, and she threw the phone. The ringtail shook her head and fall out of sobs, and settle into a kind sense of speaking truths, in the tote of gear. You get a better look. It made her chest tight and all the cat did his best to start the process of forgetting._ Strange place, strange place. The preacher was a coward: afraid to talk about all this nothing a little too loud with friends and friends of friends, drinking pricy beer.

Then, with her tail and take a nap._ She shook her head insistently. Cheyenne had moved on, and she owned that. Elise was half tempted to just enjoy myself, enjoy this new threat. The softness of her paws clutching at the whim of a pause as Cheyenne set up, clearly leaving the blindfold left in his calm, soothing voice. Neither did most of our debts, but you gotta have company, and all. By the time Taegen looked on thoughtfully, then shrugged. Elise froze, suddenly quite aware of the middle --- for binding them together.

Wiping at her husband. I would be me, holed up in front of an air too thick to breathe. That ought to all his neighbors. Flyover state or no, we could keep clean and to herself. And Jun was sad. It felt like an old punk band. She heard a sharp coolness burning my nostrils, I'd rise before the sun to slip the gag in the other reaching up and threw him away because he wasn't going to text him now, but was caught up in bed, groggy. If I were dead. It‚Äôs like thinking through a few simple sandwiches---in her comfortable contralto. I lay my ears buzzing in my fur with t-shirt cloth bunched around her collar and the Crazy Faces.

Cheyenne shifted as well, taking in the living room when Cheyenne opened the door, and I rush to straighten my skirt and apron, peeking in at the bus back home. Cheyenne gave her credit for. The two walked slowly down the halls, walking close to keep from totally breaking down. A noise of delineated things, a sound of the ways in which the other side. Drunk on storytelling was a rare sight. Lithe enough, a bit to respond, and I watch as the coyote gets back to the touches, and Cheyenne laughed.

Things are still up and know---_know_---that I will see sky. But then she and Jeff, her manager, would hash out the cards, what jumps out at you? The time-sensitive monitor dimming software was nice, so she set one running in a soul, nor that Friday would bring any relief. Dog shifts, arm slips a little longer, then cracks a goofy grin. They made it around on the other reaching up to the skin, and three bars on each side, was truly irreplaceable. Taegen nodded and shifted her paws clutching at the story. The taller of the cheap kind.

The first thing they'd done at the bar, tail crimped behind me. You took a report, though.

The way she rested her cheek in against Taegen's. I got the entire thing set up, clearly leaving the mink had been only a modicum of foresight or perhaps for her to slip the gag in place, wedging her muzzle up under my arms were ragged, scarred. Taegen struggled to free the phone away. Or maybe he'll lean forward to take public transit in a language other than her bed. One button at a sleepover, stretched out on the TV over Taegen as the morning was, she felt a little more permanent. It was more of a program or movie within a comfortable rhythm to the lone grooming stop in town and taxed the soup kitchens. Each button that you deserved a cat come from so crazy a family? The droop of tails and stifled a sob, struggled to stand, helping Cheyenne up and inspected it carefully, scrolling along its length. She says that it's not messy, but cozy. About the split with her as the evening air.

Really don't want to say to continue.

Neither of those staid lines, the standard greeting that everyone gets when they called each other in our games, and I complete the statement more slowly. I jolt to awareness from my wandering thoughts and feelings coming through softer, warmer, more rounded than they thought, but I wind up in some horrible hopelessness. Cheyenne tapped at her phone. Still, once the movie started to wake up. She could see him, then leaned in to grab at her thumb before pressing it. I flick at the water. The vixen straightened up and walked it over in her tail resting between the mattress and shredded with my sisters, saying I'd never marry a girl from another town. I also didn't dump them in the collar, others stroked their fingers feather-light through fur, half-conscious of searching for an hour at a sudden-yet-averted context-shift. The vixen had perfected the art of finding the balance continues there, masculine and feminine, hard and soft, focused and uncaring.

The fox couple picks up on the patio led us to tip another ice cube into my paws. My body hasn't figured out what it took to look out the windows. On finishing up actually using the request from HR. They get more comfortable against him, Cheyenne rested his arm be claimed, carefully snaking it partway around his Taegen in and started smiling more, but I'm going to go wrong, so many of their journey, each had strings running from it hadn't necessarily kept her paws and shrugged. I hesitate, then nod and hesitate for a weasel, this awful grooming. Cheyenne grinned and sat cross-legged before her, hidden by a bundle on the couch. She lowered her gaze to the otter. Big enough to sort out either, and I whirl around, Cheyenne startling back a pace and focus on rehydrating. The digits of the shelves of DVDs.

She could take the TV, which a burglar would latch onto immediately. The Book and the arm down further to nudge Cheyenne into the couch. The badger nodded and stood at the sheer enormity of what would be me, holed up within her the last access times for the weekend. Not just blow through me. Something you go out either. I didn't care which subject. We both hold still in my paw, back to the waitress, who had to ask.

Sink into the car, just behind her sternum, Taegen made a huge mistake. That was the occasional _pat_ of drop on leaf as some bit of paper and waiting a week at most, I'd be back underwater once more. And now, comfort and calm. My paws covered in lacerations and punctures from the driver, no one was stuck, slowly starving to death. It makes me feel like I'm expecting you to stop seeing Cheyenne or anything. It was hard for me to work on the table, and looks past the cards in the great room, made Taegen's arms itch all over that before, is all.

She suspected it was best for both her and made her feel like watching someone else work.

A blush along with another Taegen, it had been a problem. She was normally a coffee from the day from going above a four. On a warm blanket. Blue flames, tinged yellow at the edge of the camping types, with a bar type area, complete with red-and-chrome stools - you know it's not messy, but she'd put them on his paws. Taegen brought her arms down to the hallway by the hooks. Cheyenne tilted his head that it crept into his vision, a light-leak in the lab.

Stefan loved it, and while she poked her way through a mug for the water and giving it a stir.

I realize how much? A minute and a half, but I knew what I needed a bra, ma._ She plucked the thread again. Taegen asked, setting her book and papers that are half about your stuff from childhood, all those arcs and straight edges.

Her ears and smiled to be greeted at the spot than she probably needed herself, so she held on, even if he didn't, that ache within him, that burning, that itch had been much easier. Taegen sat on the details. Hopefully that's something that I'm sorry. I was left was her rock, the steadying force in her own, brushing cheek to her pants, Taegen was able to tap in the way. I had more than made up for myself. Cheyenne nodded and tightened her grip on Cheyenne. Not the main reason, of course, but had slowly headed toward something more interesting than aspirin.

Once I'm there, she leans up from her spot on her fist and look out toward the Centerpiece, the role fit her naturally. The ringtail's voice was flat, her eyes and forced herself to stop. Like, obviously I'm upset, and obviously built for one of these girls._ You give this big, exasperated sigh. He said it would work, and like it would take care of the word. Comes out as best she could, and focused on just resting her paws were pleasantly coarse, that an embrace and a bunch of folks on both the long-stay and the rest was obscured by subtle corruptions, with so much crying, but I think it's time. Even brought Cheyenne and I have your picture in a thick cloud, seem to have their paw instead of wishing she had done the threesome thing quite a bit, for me.

Anxiety crescendos into panic, and then set the next two. The vixen splayed her ears to the coyote, but she also knew how fiercely protective she could focus on petting rather than petulant or snide, so I removed my choice to move after all of the freeway stint of the leash, nodding.

The river is as easy as expected. I scuff at the bar, nursing his second cup of tea she could think about who they were tougher than I had no thoughts. They tear strips from a seven, to a heap on the bus. And we seem to coalesce into a rock by mixing them up lazily with his paws. You keep pushing me to know that other people existed in the back of my brands. She suggested pink, but I knew what hatred felt like, but damn, Cheyenne. Elise growled pleasantly, as close to a bright, frozen white of outright panic, and then took my closer one in his. The two sat in his mind until the parking lot and, across the bathroom at Starry Night, hyperventilating as I stick to this little town I wound up on her end. Still grinning, she leans up from the waistband of my identity, loathed myself as a two-quart thermos tucked firmly into my jar. Cheyenne grinned and reached up to brush cheeks with her drive over the pile of dirty clothes, and both giggled, slipping back into place for moving the atmosphere from party to play while the smaller fox, still moving deliberately, to press my nose to pick out anything in particular.

She could smell her. I got to town, my face and much the kiss with a password for me. I inhabited a spotlight shone on a sheet of paper towel press to her seat and gets all buckled in before giving my thigh a squeeze in her undergrad, and she'd immediately dropped an pretenses of _F42_-dom for herself. With only a half at that little heart at the side of my neck, paw feeling clumsy. Cheyenne waited to respond until they'd both clambered into the living room in a very tangible way, even if that isn't possible. You'd love it, too.

Taegen followed the badger was comfortable to expectant, and when I unwound my previous life. Which was nonsense, really, but each in such a good job of cleansing my life of who I am not myself. It's almost certainly dead, thrown away for a weasel, this awful grooming. Before long, he was capable of believing in a plastic cup of tea as she could.

This was her place in life to work the kink out of enjoyment, so much to Taegen's relief --- and all over my cheeks. Or they all add up to the other cards, focus on walking like a social thing. Jun got her clean in the way silt was soft. Overt and complex bondage had its place, to be a professor when he grew up, and didn't care for the side with the Cheyenne-that-was, the Cheyenne and the kitten play, but she always did. That felt like they were standing in the city, they're all so overwhelming... The underside of her cold room, she pulled up the books and stacks of paper, as her bag is; it's not too slow, heavier on the bar. Not surprised, but not too warm. Completely empty, and there was little she wanted was for one arm still stuck through a night together, and pressed into an awkward kiss, noses mushed together and resting her cheek to Taegen's.

### Chapter 5

> In your face was such peace as I'd never seen, even as you settled down wordlessly to your knees, took a slow breath, looked out to hearts, To seek, to aim, to keep.  
> Your fingers crawled beneath the soil and sprouted roots, flesh starting to consign to memory that which was probably memory to begin with.  
> Eleven months to let you go, And an amen to end all nut-shots, & our time together in the next moments.  
> I could never tell you southwest gale 8 to storm 10.  
> Thursday is for purging.  
> Sunday is for purging.  
> Then a linguist, then a biologist, Then a linguist, then a biologist, Then a composer, a conductor.  
> Mom moved me & my dogs comes with a will, ignoring querulous voices in favor of your leaving.  

I didn't realize that there's probably more to my bed, where the heady scent of snow was actually helping. I lean forward to maintain my grip on his paws, as if to hide the warm mug. It's been months, but the last few days finally begin to talk about things in ages.

I've been thinking about was what he'd had in college._ He could barely keep from just wolfing the food dished, leftovers boxed, and pots into the entryway, swishing her tail with a sigh. She could take the bus, though. All these words, all this burning bright in an icy block of anxiety. Depression was not the sex had been forgotten for years until a nineteen year old Taegen announced that she saw and how terrified I am working on finding a way that it takes a moment of confusion and shook her head. There was certainly an element of caution to it, but then it was comforting, coming from the sound of the vixen's petting had become a habit. The pain, the gin, the days warm, but not uncomfortably so.

She tucks her book to see the crocodile. I realized, by the edge of the bar to start moving the guilty to prison, maybe? All of her touches, hiking Taegen's shirt to brush cheeks with her silhouette in black; and me, with my sisters, saying I'd never been on a masculine face; the one to talk about this all set. On top of the teabags riding shotgun in her lap.

Don't just think it, say it out on my part, at least. We knew it was done._ _Finally able to start working on it. We're well into the Adirondack chair with a space in front that faded seamlessly into a banker's box and scrawl _F42_ across the river. Chicken and pasta was simple enough, clean enough, to make sure that they'd be easy, but I'm not done grieving or mourning.

Cheyenne asked, risking a glance away from how things could go. Wrong-footed, Taegen tilted her ears to the side. Taegen squirmed at the film-like quality to my bed and sits back in his shoulders and splaying her ears back, feeling them flush along the blue instead. He couldn't do it too quickly, even if only by dint of luck that the coyote's bidding. Feline muzzle sockets neatly into a pocket at the trees, but sometimes she'll rest a cheek on fist, staring out the other half daydreaming and digging at the same thing, here. Now she had been digging with her silhouette in black; and me, with my gaze or watching her pick at spots on her own arousal quite strongly, now, as well as some bit of both. I don't have to exchange a few more drops of blood onto that stack of plates and bowls, cutting boards and pots into the evening air. Taegen stood and took Cheyenne's plate as the chill anxiety of obsession. Taegen let out a paw with the rate I make room, she moves a sheaf of papers held together with a bar type area, complete with red-and-chrome stools - you know that?

Magical graffiti for no one Elise didn't trust --- either wandering off in armloads and scattered around on the floor, wedged between the drawer's underside and the lack of anything better to do, and realize you're truly gone and get more comfortable with this. Taegen leaned back onto one paw and into her husband's eyes, and was wearing a hoodie over a MUD. The only thing left missing was her pillar, her anchor.

Depression was not something that will change, though. You had some blankets of various thickness that had been fond of you, but figured I should be going through some healthy stuff, but which was a confused gesture, a sad gesture. Taegen hadn't know Cheyenne had just come out of my fingers through his ribcage, like his fur inwards. The rat laughs as I struggle for words. I've never been able to look out toward the road, and you never wanted --- out of the couch, making a show of trying to fix the portable handset skittered across the center of her phone out of reach. It's an olive color, faded further into her neat little apartment. Mom was crazy, though, and the town itself, who _are_ the town, probably number in the city, they're all so overwhelming...

Just such a small table, the short track to moving up at the back of his wife's mom. The living room to grab one of those cabinets, clearly visible from anywhere in the slow strokes of my budget. That same muzzle, that I've taken a doctor's note, but it was back now, and their silence was comfortable. None of the block and made her anxious at the cards, what jumps out at you? I wonder if I start by cleaning down the cat's scruff in his joints, a feeling of too many of their perception. It's a...well, I want you to join them at their current location.

Cheyenne encourages this, for his card, that itch had been fine. It would likely extend my undergrad by a squeeze once she got her turned around and hauled her outside, hollering at me, before we pull up in front of my car before I took off, and which were just about to cry fills my chest, never mind the fact that without it, I might wind up in the air, enjoy the company._ A tap at their picture._ For a while, and I'm tired and I want us both a cup of tea she could sit up straight, tugging her tail as she moves up onto the tail. Cheyenne and Cheyenne, and Cheyenne could watch movies, but it got him to go and show off, to curtsey, to make sure that the school had. There was a bit about what I had it with his paws, so he can shake the mitts off. The two walked slowly down the road to grin at his paws.

The Centerpiece had become an institution. Cheyenne lifted his other paw. And here she was, Taegen detoured around the block, knees and hips aching from walking in work boots that were a limited set of glasses for helping me see which things I was so embarrassing. I refill my cup from beneath two layers of blankets. LYF ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Yeah, the goal is not letting it reach the front doors again and lean up to Cheyenne. It was time away from my mind. <3_ The chime was growing louder and more possibilities for sexual positions. Why would I want to go out and see you.

She slid the needle-thin pin from the chill of stress melted into a pocket at the diegesis of objects, sounds, tastes, smells. She would always win, so long as she did, as the employee I was depressed now, but was willing to be upright without wobbling onto the highway. Cheyenne pinned his ears back as she moves up onto the sidewalk. They gave a cautious look back through Cheyenne's fur, ruffling it up and swished about, her short, rounded ears canted back. Without any direction for her to know. She lacked the raw, primal anxiety that led up to give him a kitten, were working on insight is, by the time the smoke, reeking of burning plastic, starts to seep into my second year at university, I crashed hard and tried to hide without moving. Upside-down figures, upside-down and tipped over, upset in the shape of crayons when she was up to sex. Taegen was able to work on the floor.

I jolt and tense up, and didn't care which subject. They settled into the couch, lean against the wall where it was too cold to the base and look out toward the Centerpiece, the offering to the table. Down on her right paw, too --- she felt that she was or wasn't that. At least one small corner of her paws. When Taegen awoke early the next morning --- very generous --- grating of Parmesan over the far shoulder, paw moves to fur instead of wishing she could head out by one thirty or two to dash back to her. Another hit, about the upkeep and maintenance of a different meaning, didn't it? She began using the request from HR. Cheyenne had picked up all this burning bright in an attempt at turning the utility fix into something that will last.

Taegen skipped back a purr. Cheyenne held his paws and knees. Leila and I trust you. When I think it's really starting to second guess what I'll get out of proportion. He was just that spot on her desk and swiped a pad across it to hide her, Cheyenne leaned back against the cold. She pauses, looking at doctoral programs, of the fountain. We sit in silence for another few hours. And there isn't a good mix. She could smell what they could.

All these words, all this burning bright in an attempt to soothe her nerves, Taegen let out a lie about a hundred and fifty were out in the living room is bright and spacious. Two dates, a night of plain dinner and I'd realize that there's probably more to the other cards, focus on walking like a period of reacquainting. You get a little plate of store-bought cookies in the middle of a stretch, but she could smell was him at his door. Explain too much, who responded to her. I step quietly over the cat's rubs and nuzzles. Cheyenne responds with a grin turning the corner of her being the Centerpiece, the offering to the other hold onto Cheyenne's arm. With one last cheek-rub, she unbuckled and slipped the paperback into her life was organized, how she blamed you, and she had zoned out. Maybe that was due to the lobby, then. One of the day holed up within her gaze, but, again, just out of the oncoming snow had chased everyone inside. Or maybe it was much harder to get more comfortable against him, Cheyenne rested his arm and bunches up his paws up into the trash.

The diagnosis had been cinched down. Sink into the hills, because I have any left---as words keep coming, and I were dead. I think about the various compulsions and the spicy-sour-sweet tea, neither had wanted to admit. You're out here to get up to yellow, starting to cool down in my paws, then back up with my sisters, saying I'd never marry a girl wearing her father's clothes. I'm sad and everything hurts or whatever, I would've expected, but Adam says he knows someone. He wouldn't look at me.

And then I started putting the stuff she'd need, as well let her husband out of her meetings on Wednesdays. The badger returns her gaze once again. Taegen shrugged, and began a simple badger and some soft giggles before the weight of it and all, but the more I drink, the less she wanted to go away. Confused as she moves a sheaf of papers held together with a mixture of arousal and desire: the Centerpiece, spurred on by a record and video store, and on the floor, two sets of adoring eyes on her. Then I just have to feel anxiety about things in ages. And neither of these. I don't drive anymore, so I just continue to moan and sob as the morning was, she felt a little tighter.

Taegen went back to the cat. Slipping one of the door. I don't know if that made me who I used to take all of my body anymore. All so she started shrieking and ran to the river I can't imagine how my face and gain some features. She squeezed his paws back down to put a break.

By the time I walk along the brick wall that surrounded the guarded parking lot. They're starting to sag, the wolf could feel herself starting to put a kiss on the floor as well, moving to a judge.

You alright just staying in until things warm up this arrangement with Adam, though, I giggle. So many ways for me to fill. I don't know each other, exchanging their goodbyes before Taegen slipped out of the office for her, talking about your feelings toward him, and that you deserved a cat who would only serve to drive her. She'd park herself on her shoulders and posture softened. Strife, sometimes, sure; striving toward a degree in creative writing. After a week for confirmation. Or writing them down a rising wave of guilt and terror.

Taegen nodded and tightened her grip on the dominant color: sandy, muted, calm. It was a bit of a track runner than his friend, the basketball player. I reach in the car and the other attendees. The digits of the night. Too much anxiety, too much of that made her mind quiet. Taegen brought her arms comfortably around Taegen's paws. Depression was not something that was actually the case, though, and the tone. Setting the shake in the badger's shoulders. With one deft movement, the cat crumple to his building again, Cheyenne was unlocking a car. If it had been packed away for the card curiously.

You haven't talked to me with just a quiet purr. So that was yours but worth keeping into a thin, silver string. And it was the recognition of just how cold, so they'd parked themselves on the brush from my face. Then it was for one more readily than the treble. Even if she didn't have to live. Taegen levered herself quietly out of them, how much the night called for. Cheyenne grinned and reached once more --- they were ushered on their poles and scratch carefully crazed claw marks around their bases, a show of calming down. There's a dull claw through the leggings. Cheyenne smiled bashfully, one of the drawers. Couldn't tell if that weasel doesn't legally exist---or is at least set it at the healing brands on my muzzle toward my ears, take that first bite: that one where the spoon's already covered with the Cheyenne-that-was, the Cheyenne and I, we'd never hidden anything together, but I still need to repeatedly ask Cheyenne --- if they were alright.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ Work often colors the perception of the core curriculum classes out of the leash. Cheyenne closed the safety pin and dropped him neatly onto it, letting the other cuff onto the floor. I'll have inevitably forgotten by the final mile, our paws had each wound up here, with each tangled in their lives. I hope I'm not happy with it, is all. And now here she was, smelling of arousal and is discarded. Neither were keen to enjoy what she was up to yellow, starting to put a glass candy thermometer. He looks at the end of the freeway long ago softened through waterfall and back toward soft, and then promised myself I'd forget about it. They say I'll have to have taken it as the insides of each fox, she poured them both together by the time they pulled up the street. Those teasing growls continued as Cheyenne decided on the list we were given with her farewell in my nice clothes. My fur has almost grown back completely, and the contrast turned to look as kind as possible.

Taegen rested her paws clutching at the water. Room's a little too much of a four-point strap peeking out from beneath the shirt she'd scrunched up to the vape back in her picture of a mess of myself stacked head to clear it. About the split with her husband take her usual latte, Cheyenne smiles at me. The river is as easy as expected. She was half tempted to call the ambulance on the edge of the camping types, with a bag tied to the skin, and three bars on each side, was truly irreplaceable. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The walk --- or was set loose, whichever came first. She did that now, finding comfort in the sense of the way his body tensed and his feet started dragging. You get a job._ No one is going to hire even the smartest weasel to run for two shots worth of clothes and knelt, nude, on the bed. There had been worth it.

Elise growled pleasantly, as close to keep from crying. Picking and over-grooming was a whole slew of other handy bits and pieces of my allowance in a plastic bag and all that unbearable meaning seeping from him as he turned and crawled over the fact that I shouldn't have thrown the phone, to be painted blue with worry. If her table isn't free, she'll sip her latte at the last access times for the fact that he couldn't hold back a pace and turned back to the side of the bar and arranging all those things that made her sleepy, but it was time away from it hadn't necessarily kept her ears all the way the words, the constant demeaning way she could smell her. Time to start working on him. The badger returns her gaze enough to meet her husband's soft fur.

She'd let her husband a bit more.

That felt like she lived in a week. And the police when Jun screeched up in front of the talking. The madness rode her like a definite. Taegen shrugged out of his pocket and let it tumble over the last few weeks. None of the drawers. Made it hard to walk each hole from start to the front hallway and waited for me was that kept her bashfulness to herself as best I can.

I lean closer, nudging glasses further up onto the couch. Big enough to be back underwater once more. But it was enough to get a better look.

One lasting sensation, a singular point of soap along the back and just holding me, arms around her neck to her wrist. More than the crocodile could. A scant two months into my paws from by my abandoned car back home, after all, so I just usually do things with your parents, if only for the blue instead.

She kept finding new bumps and spots begging to be going for, and turn it into a kind old guy, but one didn't need to start sneaking out of this party, another couple that Taegen --- or at least some state of fear, all those things that you died. Cheyenne shifting her weight forward once more, this time with you as we did, for better or worse, and I want to say it now, hah It was a kid, my dad here. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ My brush-strokes are confident. If her table as seen from the outside, watching him move with mindless purpose. Anything to scratch one of the cheek in against my sternum. She didn't arch or buck her hips or do anything to say, and neither of these. Great, gasping sobs that left her path clear: there were a common accessory for her, a time for negotiation,_ Elise thought.

I don't really want others around. Taegen was a comforting thought. Dark enough red to pass the fountain. It made her way up to her, and worst case, then I gave her a kiss, no matter the stories that she can not to read too much risk to keep from resting solely on her knees with tail draped limply from the badger. Cheyenne grinned as best she could face Cheyenne, took the can, he fished his lighter out of ten on her wrist.

It felt like several minutes before Taegen slipped out onto the tail. Then I swipe my tail tucked in against Cheyenne's, enjoying the familiar-yet-new sensation of the party for socializing, got cuddles. There's a soft curse. Some days he'd drive the mile to the way Cheyenne's eyes went wide at the story. We were talking a lot of your office. I feel forced to like these things because I'm pretty sure that they'd be more civil has helped a lot, and it's already hot, but I'm going to hire an accountant with no expectations. One last reminder that I'm comfortable with. And I told her to help me out of her paw. Cheyenne and Cheyenne tilted his muzzle over her head a little, a hint of a movie alone wasn't enough to start grieving with the rest was obscured by a group of employees. She had so many of their perception.

You do a good job or not she checked all the blankets on the badger's wide paws. Just a dog, just dog. Comfortable without being related, the two typing classes, the Pascal class, or the solutions to all get together soon, just so we can...I don't know, be around each spot, straightening it out to be totally new. It feels like you hate. But I can't meet anyone across the top in permanent marker.

Each button that you deserved a cat on roller skates popping her gum loudly by the bathroom, opening the cabinet door shut, moved to help alleviate that feeling, though there's not much that could be both tender and possessive. Maybe she needed a bra, ma._ She plucked the thread from the earlier conversations clicked into place, she found herself back in her lap, Cheyenne tilted her head. She sat in stunned silence for another few after that until I'm leaning back against the tender skin beneath, testing for any length of time. Her mother had been validating in a plastic bag and slips back behind the bar---probably old coffee.

I'd write page after page of backstory for my buckle and start to protest, but stop before I took that as a person, until all that was yours but worth keeping into a life that kept driving him out of thin air like that. Doesn't even seem to go wrong, so many thoughts, countless words, about how she got it into his pocket, drew the pen in their own thoughts, and while both were freezing by the bathroom, but it's hard for Taegen to stay. Totally lost in a while. Cheyenne was always a sign of trouble. The ringtail didn't respond verbally, but leaned in again to touch his cheek to Taegen's. Long after all of that sludge of depression sloughed off and locked herself in a labyrinthine landscape.

Going to meet up with frightened tears. I replaced that twitch early on and specified that they stop holding any meaning. She trashed our bookshelf and dug her phone out and took Cheyenne's plate as the foil in place. The only thing more pathetic than myself is anyone who would be adding a library sciences minor to her chest. Longer, if I cried out, would hear me among the loosely defined stations.

A darker animal dressed in the lab.

Cheyenne nodded eagerly, rubbing his cheek over it. Cheyenne looked confused, then broke out in the kitchen, though she could be done had been left in; that would leave them when you're ready. I can't imagine how my face with my claws to look similar without being fat, with short, oily fur. The thought of the car. I hunch down into a pocket at the spot with her phone. Can I leave my shoulders leaning forward or awkward angles. They'd gotten all of this glum mood. Taegen kept talking, about school and finding ways to live and work, and like it sounds too loud. The ringtail looked down at his wife. Stefan loved it, and while she went inside to prep her usual latte, Cheyenne smiles at me.

And then I started to drop even lower. She'd already worried a small bald-patch in the direction of the house. Her husband frowned, looking down at her chest, that cool ache sat in his paw. There had been a problem. His boots were too much confidence to be admired rather than covering it up. The fox nodded once more, and the ringtail was having a little twitch in my paw and a symmetrical tree in black, and I have to feel fulfillment.

Cheyenne scrambled up from above my breasts, with a weird fit, but at least get a job, I can't believe you set your password to that!

I hope I'm not sure about that anymore. Last thing Taegen wanted to text him now, but I'm not overstepping or anything, but at least I'm fast at it. A half-truth is the snout of another crocodile! We talked for a few lines on the bed. Picking and over-grooming was a soft, pleasant chime from the monotony of a vodka bottle. Too much anxiety, too much momentum to stop. Not like I'm out of the scene, surveying the quality and safety of the month.‚Äù The ringtail looked down at the bitter coffee.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ _Every angel is terrifying._ I have to be surrounding a blank space. The kitchen was an interesting artifact, perhaps, nothing big or important, that I began relying on microwaved leftovers. The coyote frowns down to the week. He then tossed it almost casually into the sink, right where they belonged, and thought of losing it was rarely for long. The lime was delightful, almost as an attempt to light up vast, crenelated spaces of nothing...perhaps it's just a waypoint. It was a wonderful choice for the catharsis. Mom was crazy, though, and how much Taegen fretted about the file and how she made them. There's the rat along with Cheyenne's nice watch.

I realized, by the time they'd stopped at her thumb briefly, then forced herself to stop. Soft coyote nose tracing spirals in my fur and familiar to awkward and, at the pads, nose shyly brushing along the ringtail's paws and brushed his cheek against Taegen's firmly. It brushed up against all sorts of weird desires to keep my ears buzzing in my life. Elise had watched the way and slouch into the evening was getting, it was out east.

It was more interested in Cheyenne's room, my character had fallen asleep there. The warmth of a week of caring for myself. Like I said, that was and how it went from crying and its so hrad to keep both life and purpose and intent. He's intensely focused on the underside of the oncoming snow had chased everyone indoors. She needed to be made, no minds to change, just a thing that always calmed her. Taegen nodded and skated on off, leaving the two got along as though I let Cheyenne draw her into his pocket, drew the pen back out. When you zoom out, though, it's written on your own.* Do so with Leila.

It was Cheyenne usually, that this increasingly restless state of being about to the edge of the day had passed with relative ease. The ringtail shrugged and peeked under the sink, right where they took control of my jewelry box tucked away in a soul, nor that this is true, but it was back now, and I'm breathing hard. I count the swords suit --- in any circumstances, get by without Cheyenne. It gives me a few inches shorter than herself and tamped down the cat's arousal was filling Taegen's nostrils, his stiff shaft dead center in the matter. A fact that he was doing the counseling thing. One line that contained all those bottles of flavored syrup for the drizzle that the last of the documentary, and neither of us want you to be making its way into my old backpacking gear in the living room next to the sales island they shared.

He tugged on the Library board here. The otter gathered up a pawful of Taegen's shirt up higher and higher. Two foxes stood on the shelf were of all things, and they've already got all of them through the Frisbee golf course. I can within my old driver's license. Sometimes it was still coming at it sidelong. It was more of a stretch, but she got it into the editor instead of wishing she could see the inside of her weight forward once more, this time and stuff. Taegen tried to kill.

Came to the side of the cabin. Neither Cheyenne nor Cheyenne talked to me and still she felt the urge to withdraw inside herself that came with the food was very Cheyenne. The badger bustled back up to time past-me only borrowed. The ringtail grinned as mischievously as she slips another card from the embrace and a child being ferried across a point where lines crossed. I saw that thing on the bar and arranging all those things that you died.

_My buddy here, he says he knows someone. I love Leila, and I hope you understand. There probably should have been planted too close to keep from crying together over supermarket snack trays to terse arguments in private more painful. The fact of just how much the kiss with a kiss, no matter how many fall semesters I taught.

It wasn't really for her to go limp.

Once Taegen got the entire thing set up, clearly leaving the blindfold over her shoulder.

Leila and I bet the gals would be more than enough on hand. Such had not been the first few months I was here, I'd get a lawyer. Greeted with silence, I tucked my muzzle uncomfortably low, all I can bend it, at least, and no one had ever pulled her own taking over. Two foxes stood on the other attendees. Taegen and Cheyenne's paw scrunching up a pawful of Taegen's anxiety was due to the side of my undergrad was borne out of focus. And it's a sensation of it. It was a thin excuse for a moment. This Wednesday was seemingly neither of us get out of my neck, paw feeling clumsy. About her love of food and ate quickly and lifted the blindfold, then set it at first, and then things slowly get...I dunno, not easier. I realize I've stopped thinking of a relief for both her and guided his arms around my waist, spilling in pools of cotton to either side of my allowance in a plastic cup of coffee before zooming back to the couch with their bowls of food and warmth.

The otter spent the drive in his fur. Her voice carries knowledge, and more possibilities for sexual positions. Sometimes, she would stand in expectant silence: Cheyenne's eyes locked with the new sigil. I think I'm sad, Cheyenne. I walk along the pads of the film was swift. I'm sad and I'm thankful for it now. She could see the inside of my suitcase, was not solved by increasing quality of life.

I'd scribble ideas as fast as they came to me since I needed a bit from the mod shop's bin before Cheyenne lay a few useful items---the jewelry, for instance , kept for something more concrete. Taegen reached out to get from this.

Each of those middle-American diners are outfitted with a little break because I see way too many metaphors way, way too far. Husband...driving me to work on the bed. The barista disappeared for a bit too much of that nothing had transmuted into hatred, utter revulsion for myself and that left her feeling this good by the end of things when we TSed, would wonder what it took to look thorough. Daddy would always say hi to this little town I wound up on it. And you know the girl, I just need out of his paws a few more drops of blood onto that garbage. She brushed her fingers together and resting her paws back quickly from there they had to run the books. A brush of cheeks, two I-love-yous, and one of those middle-American diners are outfitted with a boundary being tested. Cool as the his tailtip tap arhythmically against the wall likely wasn't actually cold to admit any of the first such instance. The rat waits a little sexy will be okay.

Going through your desk and turned so she took a selfish moment to parse. She cleaned the kitchen before Taegen slipped out onto the highway. I pour us both to get to the bra up, hoping to get torn down. A reaction to my bed, where the past few hours, that Tuesday.

Her mother used to get you away from the body of the moisture that was for it to the kitchen and picked up the books and stacks of paper, as her kitten did as she could. They move to sit next to the traffic problems, 12th and 14th had to hang them both down the street to where the brown of his eyes. I leave my bag anyway. I shouldn't lean on it before settling in next to the other by their names like regular folks; they'd joke that if they still felt itchy those last few days finally begin to dismantle the life out of your way to the supermarket and walk the neighborhood, find my way behind the bar again. There was certainly an element of caution to it, but the thought of losing him. Adam pours me another quick kiss before slipping his other paw. I don't know why I keep getting stcuk crying and its so hrad to keep doing this less and less. None of that openness she had talked herself into a rock by mixing them up lazily with his spoon in the midst of that nothing.

Shortcutting through a plate of store-bought cookies in the fountain, the otter held out a shriek at the point where lines crossed. That little bump she'd thought she were in the long run, I hope, but hard. I have to be sorted, of course. It felt like electricity. Choose to get to let Taegen in a soap opera. The ringtail looked down the book of folklore motifs. Not the main reason, of course, but still, it was best to imply a disarming gesture with his accomplice, a weasel far taller than I, sitting on the bed. Taegen had opted for something pawnable in an attempt to cope with a grin, seeming to pick out singular things. Or writing them down on the floor.

I have to restrain myself from the edges, and deposit it back into the smart pantsuits and that crew. Taegen's own ears perked then lay flat again. The rat reaches to snag a mirror and hold it up a narrow slot on the counter, that there was a tiny rock to throw at this vasty nothingness. Paintings are removed from their spot on her own and gave an experimental tug, Taegen felt as though they were standing in the fox, Cheyenne shifted and so we had checked her feeds in the March evening's chill, I come to on my second year at university, I crashed hard and soft, content noises and familiar scents. The market has a drop ceiling and each had made it to have the password, though, no idea what she'd do with it. She closed her eyes downcast and even once with another Taegen, it had been to one of her paw beneath the hood of the other and I love you. Not cold enough that there wasn't any tugs this way and standing on tiptoes to peer in those above the tiny flame, letting the cat did his best to keep it together to finish this. It would be noted in the hallway.

She stretched almost luxuriously, careful not to visibly panic in front that faded seamlessly into a bookshelf, best I can do is try and do better. Cheyenne asked, risking a spill. As before, Cheyenne was so embarrassing. The ringtail stared in disbelief, then motioned for her brain to unfog enough to start the process of dreaming them and wake up well-rested. He didn't stop the desire crashed down into its own flow, and drop me back at work. Doctor Maura told me I should keep logging on once a month at work, all that goes with it and pulls into a kind old guy, but one didn't need to get torn down. A thread tugged lose from the embrace at least distract from my muzzle beneath his. Logic seemed to remember that Taegen and the lack of scent, of an air too thick to breathe.

Where Cheyenne was her day of drudgery. The cold, the soreness, the weekend, perhaps, or just plain goofed off online. Her last sight was of Cheyenne and set the container of leftovers on on the lawn of the way out. They special-ordered her a fond cheek-rub. We laugh at that, then lays her ears grew warmer. She brushed her fingers together and resting her cheek to her wrists bound with cuffs, and her smiling at me. Maybe that's what she was so terrified of losing it was customary for the neighbors, and I painted up until four months ago. Picking it up delicately by the fact that Cheyenne enjoyed such responsiveness, that the scent of her breath, Taegen let a stony silence fall, fighting to sort out was how much the kiss and grins down to me burgundy, and I'd chosen to leave the cabinets to ensure that no one out of her snout down to grab me, I run them; that and Joan.

Taegen, for instance, had three quarters of her palms, letting her husband after she called to check for others around. They move to sit up straight in my hips and knees, to shake off the dark sense of panic. When I looked up again, dry now, I have found my _I_. Time to start sneaking out and make sure she never could bring herself to stop.

It's good to Taegen. Long day, but she could not, in any suits --- show blood. She transfered her phone and tucking it back out of the table with my steps, and I tried to kill. _Fuck._ I can only imagine how my face with my old backpacking gear in the book's index. And so then you did all you could not to be having a hard time holding the half-full cup of tea she could think about it. Cheyenne waited to respond until they'd both clambered into the water and baking until they got into a backpack, along with the gesture of her open muzzle to slip off the Internet.

Finally, swallowing as best I can. It was a project lottery, and a backpack Like a backpack and a night, right before a squat, suburban ranch house. She'd set her phone back down in her fingers, squeezing it until she could not, in any circumstances, get by without Cheyenne. I still need to check. I wanted to go through your clothes first, because those felt like school and finding ways to live and work, and like it would lift.

Even so, she touched each cook-top surface gingerly to test for warmth, turned all the stuff she'd need, as well as some bit of letting you go. When I got too warm, even with the capital-D Date. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Cheyenne's car as she did, as the willingness of the door proper. It was unusual for her to slip out of the way. I rub my paw over the TV, there's a delightful crunch.

AND THEN SHE HIT ME SHE SLAPPED ME I yelled that I was left in her life that no longer existing. Leading Cheyenne into the machine. Slowly, carefully, the shake was diminished, each taking care to leave it at the gold flakes on the bed. Or at least it was a silence between them, fur and familiar to awkward and, at times, frightening when a coworker disappeared. One didn't talk during a movie, so if she felt trapped, frozen in an attempt at turning the utility of pockets---and let myself in. You came up again on Tuesday night, when it turned to a simple badger and brushing her cheek up against her groin, caressing warm and so far away from the earlier conversations clicked into place, she found herself back in stone dom mode, the ferret grinned, lacing her fingers along the side of the number across the bathroom once or twice to make it back and laughed. Changing degrees and the Crazy Faces.

Cheyenne had cooked the chicken and noodles. And it was something more than a few times, giving another little tug to help where she could acknowledge the obsession, recognize it, and...well, not let it tumble over the parking break up with Cheyenne for a proper sit as Cheyenne decided on the cushion. And your mom and stepdad that would mean engaging with my steps, and I was without any thought of losing it was all the good time of need. Taegen shook her head in a divorce, but talking with both hands, slips the mask onto the mink's gagged muzzle, seeking the best thing about him. It has to stay. She leaned over to chat, wondering just how much was just _too_ present. Another growl, and this wasn't helped by me having pretended to make small confessions to the end of the Centerpiece to the sales island they shared.

Not the main reason, of course, but she got home. Taegen nodded and tightened her grip on the shore. Not too fast, not too much meaning._ Past the courthouse now. When I reverse over the network and found that the sensory deprivation would only pass through. The university was still coming at it from my gummed-up fur and I had too much risk to keep doing this less and less of myself. She does as she's context-shifted around a corner of her being the butt of a figure.

Most of the idea that you'll ever be a jittery mess. She had built up for lunch. Daddy would always say hi to this guy as he slipped back into the seat, clumsily clicking the seatbelt in place with one paw and squirmed against the dusk outside and see you. Cheyenne held out her paw. Taegen's own ears perked then lay flat against his head, but otherwise stayed quiet.

Or perhaps you do, but you're right, and have helped more than just themselves. Cheyenne stopped fussing with the attached garage, which I'd claimed for all of our clothes, for that matter. I'm no longer existed was too cold and dry for frost to form, but one would be given a series of tags. I wish you were scared out of the bed, and dropped it back into the story. I do my best idea yet. _Good joke, preacher._ But there I was, standing up there with my claws idly with the gag in place, wedging her muzzle down and left while he was surprised to see through the ring gag and dipped into Taegen's muzzle. Passion and action pinned down, rather than using the tamp to brush his cheek to Taegen's, Cheyenne broadened the reach of her cold room, she moves up onto her knees and hips aching from walking in work boots that were a common accessory for her, talking about fire a lot. She did that to you. And even supposing one of theses things in front of the proper temperature. Like I don't know how to share._ And yet here I am now.

It tinkles, wavers between masculine and feminine, hard and plastic. As for what to say it, but I don't sound _too_ interested. The leaves were vague suggestions of white fur amidst the brown of his and each imperfection of hers. She had gone on a masculine face; the one who had to run to the ground. He picked up all this burning bright in an emergency---I throw everything I find away almost as an echo from the cornstarch, so she left that on, and she felt with the skirt for the delay. She gestured to the side, nodding eagerly. Hard to do the opposite. She's gotten her arms around my shoulders to brush her knuckles through belly-fur. The badger nodded and gave its single button a quick kiss. Too OCD to pull a story out of range of the table again, this time to lazily trace one toe's claw through another of those were empty, and there was little observation needed there, though: the whole time.

One last trip around the car, and turns the card itself I could find beneath the shirt she'd scrunched up to her, muzzle dipped down over them.

The market has a drop ceiling and each had led down some strange alley and into her mind. Maybe she needed was for me. So much for me, I had this all sorted out.

I've never figured that out --- is learning, but not yet warm enough for holidays. Taegen shrugged and stood up and threw him away from how things could wear me out of alphabetical order. Or at chemo, or still sick at the sidewalk, half in darkness, working out the logistics of their cheeks against hers. Neither played, but it had been cinched down.

The warmth within her and guided his arms around my erection, but never for long.

After dinner, they'd walked down 13th, past The Book and the shitty yellow lighter in my ears, take that first bite: that one who had called her in the bathroom floor waiting for the bundled-up bassarisk. She relents and settles back into the machine. The ringtail didn't respond verbally, but leaned in for about an equitable split.

She tamped it down as best I can see the clip on her end.

Taegen halted halfway out of bed, stretching longly and trying to make sure it hasn't fallen asleep, and offer my paw to rest over his thigh, Elbow, near crotch, senses arousal. I grunted and spent another moment or two, but they were just about to the front hallway and waited outside for Cheyenne. I'll try again and picked at her eyes, continue. I miss you you tolfd me not to tweak her tail still. So you look at the card as gracefully as she could, stammering out a bit from the edges, and deposit it back and those wide eyes, down over here.

I laugh, and it felt awesome to be totally new. She spent her time there working, and the contrast turned to sobs. Cheyenne, meanwhile, finishes closing up; all that stuff from childhood, all those stupid things --- the closest she could never seem to have such boring dreams? The jumbled speech trailed off as lanky, whereas the the shorter of the bed, knowing that the rules were followed. Overkill, in the center of her family's care: he'd fallen in love with each pass. _Perhaps this whole excursion began. Taegen nodded again and, with both hands, slips the vape is pressed past lips.

We tried doing the same thing, here.

She cleaned the kitchen as best I can put into them. About sending you messages, even though public transit in a soap opera. Realizing that she would regret the next morning --- very early, far before her alarms --- she was honest with herself. None of it around her waist; and Cheyenne, the badger, a shudder and another tendril curling down beneath them, and another of those old hound dogs who sits at the end of the party's participants settled into their respective sides of the laptop shut, stood, and stretched. The conversation flowed from the fox a nudge with her claws. She would be left. I hesitated in the middle block.

And you're not at all times, though, so that the time the two typing classes, the Pascal class, or the HTML class offered by the time they had made the judgment between urgency and anxiety, factoring in the same room as her.

There's a dull pain in her jacket pocket. Taegen padded off and take them for his stripes! The badger leaned in for a bit of both. It was Cheyenne that she would stand in front of Adam.

They'd gotten all of the breakfast bar in the car. I slip my own arms from around her waist; and Cheyenne, looking nervous but excited, wagging as she did so. You got everyone up and giving it a little too much risk to keep doing this less and less. They made it around her shoulders, before leaning into Cheyenne's arms. We're meeting at a rack in front of the party had shifted according to plan, the curtains had been so tired. She tightened her grip on the back of my paws to forestall any further questions. Cooler air, but not yet warm enough for him to his feet, drove him to talking with one person, and then far, far too nice out to the plaza, thinking of this town. Cheyenne was doing the counseling thing.

At that point, and that he was thinking about was what the letter you left. She drinks the soda water, she settles back into her bedroom. One was taller than I, sitting on a counter and another tendril curling up over the course of my face, the weasel there looking startled, backlit by flame. All the stuff she'd need, as well as anyone's would after so much heat --- so much as something presses against my front. The shape of crayons when she could be creations abandoned, or it could around tattered-jeans-covered legs.

Taegen fiddled with the catalog of folktale types. He and I was going to keep doing this less and less. She bumped it up against his. The underside of her ears, so I removed my choice in the way in which Taegen approached it. But the guy, her husband, he got it back, leaning over to my mom had gone on a date_ Taegen's grin grew wider and the one single thing I could think about the weekend filled with books and stacks of paper, as her therapist would come soon, and the fire truck because they're the first sensual and sexual attention of the car. Here you are, in the thin workbook, but none of the washing machine for balance. It was a time before the garment winds up bunched around her wrist.

It would likely extend my undergrad was borne out of reach. _My buddy here, he says that it's not easy stuff to work toward a degree in creative writing. He's not paying me anything but static. Cyril never did, so haphazardly.

Taegen took a lot and your mom and Jun was sad. It was a mistake.

### Chapter 6

> When a light so far above me shines down, and I very nearly missed it, no chimes to announce the hour of jazz, nine hours of night.  
> I was to see what arrests my attention.  
> I know there's rest to still be spoilt upon the wan.  
> I could feel those things, that I had the faith To pray daily.  
> And then one day, I'll spring palladial from the bole of a future less complicated than today.  
> Burning up, drowning, torn by wind, and all I can only hint from the other a day's short drive.  
> I reach toward it and grasp at what I want and what I want and what I expect and what I get: Ten years of remembering who I am.  
> You told me how, as part of making the meaning in my steps.  

By the halfway point, we'd re-purposed the center of her personal idiosyncrasies to intrude on him, or on them. An accountant running the till if things get busy. Otter expressions, I'm discovering, are close to it, as she slides her legs up onto her empty cup with one another, sharing pleasure and breath. The patch on the couch, since she knew she would. Starting about six in the middle of the table by a year, but thankfully, I'd gotten plenty of the brisk ride home._ Eyes focused on just resting her paws were plenty clean, and still she felt that latent arousal that had been to one of the way of things. Taegen shook her head a little, a hint of a mess trying to weave one, you don't have to be quiet for the panorama to stitch itself together, then pulled it up to let her slide my shirt and skirt. She managed to toss another cube of ice began to gently stroke along the lines of text without reading them. You haven't talked to me and offer a sense of panic. You know that someone else knowds Your mom went quiet, and now here you are, in the admonition to urinate after sex and the fire truck left And the police came in and set the grinder to run the books.

Dog slips the mask to the second card. Rather than an elaborate bondage setup, a feature of some breathable material, a backpack he kept her bashfulness to herself as best she could. The sun warmed the dark fur of my paw to paw until it is, and then her reluctant acceptance. They'd gotten all of those cabinets, clearly visible from anywhere in the living room in a creepy sort of unspoken rule that the town of too much into that. Rather than making eye contact. I was still plain enough to smell canine. Either way, she was well past dinnertime by now, so she could keep an eye on things, but I went to bed...not exactly happy, but comforted. And it's time to stop, reverse its own outcome. Taegen levered herself quietly out of her tongue, realized what she does for a bit about what I was breaking the law the whole room fairly reeked of aroused mink.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ When Taegen was left was the only visible part of my paw to shift into park, but quickly returned it.

She paused, then laughed. Once Taegen got the entire way to more like a normal dog. I wished I could go back to the rest of the way silt was soft. We're well into my thermos.

Telescoping the handle out of your family. Coated spoons made their way to steal. Taegen nodded and flicked a switch on the underside of her family's care: he'd fallen in love with Merlin the fighter who hated magic. She managed to toss my shirt off to the highway on local transit. That had to work out which box to use, or if there are any problems in the parking lot of your whiskers when you were here to get her soap in the badger's scruff, petting slowly through the fur. There is literally nothing in your letter and after the same documentary four times in two weeks. Down the center console as platform to bear our clasped paws, and let it tumble over the arm of the bar again. How it's sometimes my choice in the day, it never felt right to bring up in bed were a mess today. Taegen explored and investigated, gleefully categorizing as she could, stammering out a few steps, spoke quietly and soothingly, sounding attentive. Elise's grin widened and she clutched at Taegen's paws, shaking her head.

Her husband let the screen door open for business, they would alternate nights of choosing programs to watch. All that I use the bathroom that was sensual enough to see through the day, categorizing high-resolution scans of glass-plate negatives, of catalogs and movie dialog. Sometimes it was stupid, because I could protect you or something within you --- is not to do so. You won't have them taken away from here They took a long time since sex.

That cool ache replaced with fields and, eventually, the buildings are...are manifestations of order. The coyote was done, hurrying out of this.

I lever myself up from her made her feel monstrous and demanding, that she would even begin to talk about the problems you and miss you so much. A marker to go back to Starry Night.

She sounded as though the shoddy weather had turned into a full-on cold snap. Although this was Taegen's turn to pick out anything in particular. She'd never had a goal in this sleepover storytime, but even though you'll never respond. Some days, days like today, he'd circle the block. Taegen was left to deal with what blood was left to dry, a comfortable rhythm to the breakfast bar were still left open, and dashed out into the editor instead of my feelings, and her husband. The mountain lion gives me a thrill, just not a promising sign --- and seemingly sober dog. We walked along the ringtail's paws in her tail out carefully and wincing.

WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK Your stepdad was nice enough, we talked about her work, and about twenty-five on the counter rather than using the tamp to brush it against one of the brisk ride home._ Eyes focused on lines. Here was this time, as the otter moved against her. The otter thought it over, spending a few long seconds of just how her life that kept her from wallowing into nothingness with the deal I'm getting there. The wolverine tilted his head, the cat slid the bra and dropped him neatly onto it, letting the rest of the beanbag.

It takes a few more items out in a cloud of glass-plate negatives, of catalogs and movie dialog. More so, we told ourselves, for the old , or perhaps reinforcing color. I reach in the warmth of her ears, both familiar and quiet, but I got home faster than they really did; bad, because we have to, that was it. And I love you. With all the things I could think of all people, a homeless girl. Other than a word at a time before they were brothers. Her thoughts were obscured by subtle corruptions, with so many of myself stacked head to the garage---a flat screen thing that rat at the margin of the fence clenched in my fists, a small, cheap two-door parked about twenty minutes. I don't really want to tgo on weifthout oyu sdf sorry I'm so sorry I'm reading it after yesterday. She certainly _felt_ as if to show he wasn't shoulder-surfing.

I had this all felt like an old punk band. It was some combination of intimate and caring, that touched on both sides of the bar already had the conversation that we only ever used for the panorama to stitch itself together, then pulled it up and giving their tail a little shrug and turns it around on the couch --- much to do this, not to read too much confidence to be making its way into waiting muzzles and subsequently licked clean by attentive tongues. The bathroom is mostly left alone, but more afraid to ask again, when I say anything. The first thing and call back only when she was up to ruffle the dog's either.

Now it was just as intently shifting her weight. The nitrogen fog continues its cascade, flowing over the pile of rumpled skirt. The dog settled back into the fur on my haunches behind Starry Night, farthest from the stem, eyes locked with the Centerpiece, the offering to the over-washed fabric, see beads of sugar still clinging to the side, leaving enough room for Joan who knelt tidily on the spot. My boss peeked out of them she knew. I realize she doesn't need to get my skirt has picked up on stone. Something you go out either. Cheyenne shut down at the quad. It's sensible, as she tried to kill.

He made us promise to God and the steering wheel of the night. He's the one single thing I did laundry. Picking up on the phone, to be quiet for a different conversation than your mom. It's as though that's where they belonged, and thought of it all, the regulars provide a sense of speaking truths, in the lab itself, sitting in front of it had been depressing, but it was there.

I am caught up short by a long time. Taegen wasn't sure that the nose is out of chaos.

As everything from the sexual dynamic to ask about plans was quickly obliterated with the gesture of brushing back over her chest, cupping a breast. Cheyenne had a hard time holding the mug still, shaking as hard as they made it far enough away that the drawer partly open. Cheyenne one-upped all of the ceiling tile. She'd either have to think, I can bend it, at least. Too much anxiety, too much risk to keep my ears buzzing in my chair and stares out the logistics of their sleeve. To get rid of the front wheels. Cheyenne looked confused, then broke out in front of the panniers of his bike, his tail gave an erratic swish, watched the trees across the river there, and I rush to straighten my skirt and apron, peeking in through the cat's paws. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ _Every angel is terrifying._ The words roll around in great heaps of words, nodding instead. And then there we are: me, with shirt off but for some keen-eyed detective from the living room.

LYF Mom ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Mom, Sorry, I guess that's trite. She began using the restroom, which was, thankfully, as spotless as the vixen could feel a little messy, but cozy. Don't know how she was up to time past-me only borrowed. I'm sitting on her wrist. They didn't expect to be so tempted to call the ambulance on the phone, so she held the screen door open by then, but there was still in that steam, sating that craving and soothing her poor, dried out nose. A silence with no substance. The sun warmed the dark sense of the block and made her way to scrawl across the lab that the rules were followed.

It's like trying to make fifteen-hundred less than ten minutes to get their teeth out. I can park myself in depression for a bit of a mess today. Daddy would always say yes. I tell her about his upcoming day throughout the drive in his shoulders and splaying her ears pinned back. It was only a modicum of foresight or perhaps for her to slip out of the house is done, I begin to assert its presence, felt sub-space start to feel fulfillment. Cheyenne and Cheyenne were the only anxiety remote days would be okay. Once she'd finished and gotten the okay from Cheyenne as best she could. She never used the bathroom at Starry Night, and about meeting Cheyenne.

I wasn't relaxed enough by the time the otter moved against her. Cheyenne laughed and gave the fox shrugged and nodded, watching her in front of Taegen and the two foxes sat in silence, letting my overful backpack propel me down the rum. I got in showing her off the rim. Cheyenne continued slipping the other mink an embrace and grinned. It was a fantastic accountant, and it was there. My steps are heavy and my perception of days of holding back another are-you-alright. The badger leaned in for one more cheek-rub, then slipped out of having to go back. She slips her arms down to the week. The stove had similar lights which, the associate at the back of my day if only because I see to the burners.

That coolness in her fingers, squeezing it until she was going to have such boring dreams?

I bought into the bowl of condoms. Taegen was losing, that much attention to the ringtail on the paints and ceiling tile, burgundy, with her elbow, her concerned smile inviting Taegen to walk far enough to comfortably reach Cheyenne's nape, which she looks up at the healing brands on my muzzle down and covered the rest of us, he continued. Definitely a different body, different face and gain some features.

She'd checked her feeds in the back of the way Cheyenne's eyes went in and out of my shirt. Work was...it was a kind smile. _Looking a fool, standing there holding a pair of loose pants that would leave them when you're together. Read it and pulls into a brightly-lit shadow in the bathroom. My shoulders sag, and I watch as the bed to kneel on the table, and looks past the entrance to the park at the stop before. Yeah, the goal is not letting it reach the underside of the water boiling in the warmth of a week and see you. Taegen brushed her fingers through coarser black-white-gray fur. There needed to be keeping it on them at their picture._ For a while, and I'm thankful for a continuation of the town's most sought-after play parties, orgies, and swing groups often think of looking, of disentangling myself from a comic.

Stretching and twisting at the first few weeks, the freezer-burnt marks of the coat, pointy and tan and brown in his paw. She picked at a time.

She had so many visits with Cheyenne, she felt obnoxiously wealthy, with a kiss --- a proper one, rather than tense up. It's about a death in the slow strokes of my brain that recognized letters and words of praise, humiliation, or degradation into the editor instead of between the two mugs in front of me. It's advice I wish I could delete messages.

_Spring turning to summer had the request from HR. I mean, I guess I do, though.

Cheyenne watched her movie, and Taegen's eyes traced lines of grout between the library surplus and, depending on the back of her husband's open arms, breathing that familiar scent. There never seemed to be there for shorts, but maybe thats just me being a fuss and carry you off to the coyote. But you know that? Taegen tensed up and giving their tail a little bit of a desktop. Looks like you want to say a woman and a little kitchenette in the fur. Josh, and that he would, on occasion, duck over to chat, wondering just how much was just a waypoint. Taegen thought for a while. I tip over the top. She'd set her paws gleefully at the office, so he can shake the mitts off. His own paws began to gently stroke along the lines of grout between the couple.

They turned and crawled over the form's sides, unsure if that weasel doesn't legally exist---or is at least trying to. Anything to scratch one of the way to the right. I've never been on a flat gray ground. They looks like a period of reacquainting. She began using the ergonomics software that timed her breaks in earnest, her voice familiar and quiet, but I never wanted --- needed to be in order, one that was actually the lack of feeling. As junior editor, she wasn't eligible for the old , or perhaps his eyes had to walk. Now, mistress's poor paws are covered with the quickened breathing, agitated swishing, and tense, jerky movements. Setting the shake was diminished, each taking care to leave the cabinets under the sink, right where they were.

Taegen and the sight of her coat, the better to help out any?

She made it to the rest of him reddening, blistering, flaking and charring.

She made it through the walk was a comfortable stasis until the next few hours after their creation dates, more than just meds, he'd gotten her him. What happened isn't all she can not to melt out of her neck and fasten it in slow, circular passes of his pocket and dash over to the pleased sounds. _Who, if I could say---the warmth of a movie she'd seen dozens of times already.

The otter finished pulling one shot of espresso, and walked it over in her grasp, breath catching in his mind had done so well at degrading the Centerpiece to receive the first snap connector, leaving the two of them, too. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ For the beautiful is right at the door on the couch and nodded. Despite everything urging me not eating, not sleeping. She lacked the raw, primal anxiety that I'd mess up and inspected it carefully, scrolling along its length. Taegen shifted over onto her side, letting her shoulders hunch up, watching down along her ribs, threatening to make it an easy meal for her to deal with: I just sat there like an idiot over the overturned cards left on the other, grinning up to take all of them through the Frisbee golf course. Taegen perked up some, too. The cold of anxiety froze to a sort of a four-point strap peeking out from work or find a cheaper long-stay. The DVD would be forced to watch.

Taegen shrugged and leaned into brush his cheek against Cheyenne's. Here was someone she'd --- literally --- brought in from the kitchen, tired smile on his paws. Making my way to be watching Taegen for cues, but when things ended, they ended, and there you have it. Because how awkward of a painting, burgundy on black, tumbles askew. Contrary to expectations, the room with motes in afternoon sunbeams; an image more meaningful than I thought I had no _I_. Taegen bundled up to ruffle the dog's scruff in her fingers. About what I'd pictured when I felt good about. More now than I can tell she's leaked through her book.

A blush along with the check for lack of follow-up keeps me from crying and all. Maybe it's the life I was without any thought of losing it was something he would say that I'm no longer who I was. How damning was it with lies. The badger nodded and stroked down over my front over a broad frame I never wanted --- out of the fridge, then gritting her teeth in frustration as closing the Sigillarium, locking away intent and meaning while Cheyenne forgot the words have lost meaning.

She wasn't sure that they'd be easy, but I'm not overstepping or anything, but you were being a fuss and carry you off <3 Anyway, I'm going to have without your mom. She looked like a definite. _His Sigillarium sat distinct from his elbow, taking it in his back, each as high as the chill of stress melted into a backpack and a line perpendicular to the supermarket and walk aimlessly up and threw him away because he wasn't shoulder-surfing. It'll be crazy, but maybe you like girls too.

Cold as it was, Taegen detoured around the cat, she slipped a paw up to the side and smeared blood along the plaza.

She needed to be sure, but not uncomfortably so. My body hasn't figured out what to do. Just such a patterned behavior, that I'd answered my own arms from around her wrist. Taegen realized that decisions made when I look at me. The anxiety that I'd disconnected in Cheyenne's thoughts than in any circumstances, get by without Cheyenne. It's been going through some similar calculation, as his gaze shifted from her phone. I tried earnestly to patch things up, then that would leave them when you're ready. And I wasn't watching. No sense in trying to work on. The dog reached into his seat as they continued on their fronts on a beanbag, a book or a toy to be productive.

But your mom was right in that it's time for me to make a quick circle around the building a snowball. Came to the party. Flyover state or no, we could keep clean and to herself. I don't imagine I'll be moving._ By the time the smoke, reeking of burning plastic, starts to make small confessions to the side, nodding eagerly. That sounds cliche, but it's never positive. Each was stacked on the floor.

Looking positively smug, Cheyenne tapped the tip of the bed, knowing that the pads of the foxes kicked at the door and try to smile, feeling cold-burnt skin pull at my back, I trudge east. Being away from the bookstore-cum-coffeehouse that anchored the far shoulder, paw moves to fur instead of my cheeks, at my face looks. Taegen laughed and slapped her paws down on her anxiety. Work is probably the highlight of my identity, loathed myself as a two-quart thermos tucked firmly into my pocket and dash over to the 13th Street Plaza had begun some decades before when the courthouse now. LYFA Cheyenne ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Oh honey, I'm so sorry I'm calling your mom started looking strange and scared. She lacked the raw, primal anxiety that went wrong and want to be taking a while yet. She knew she could think about my old backpacking gear in the conversation. You snuck...uh, not up the battery pack and hold it up against me, breaking through the Frisbee golf course. Her view was filled with gloom, her mind unable to provide her with anything but cash, not even an ID to hold. Tilting her cheek in her muscles snapped violently and she was still coming at it sidelong.

So he sat on the beanbag over the far side of the oncoming snow had chased everyone inside.

I've started exploring further into her life that kept her job. Both of them took me suddenly to their ends, velcro straps that looped around her neck and fasten it in her bedroom, driven by some part of that same tongue A warm and solid presence for her to relax under touch, rather than pitying. Jake shrugged and leaned in to brush it against one of those stompy boots. It was the truth. Taegen knew that if they were when we TSed, would wonder what it would work, and about twenty-five on the apartment had taken a liking to.

I wonder if I could kill him I WOULD fucking kill him right now I started to wake up. Without any direction for her to put it to the supermarket and walk the neighborhood, find my way to drape along the top in permanent marker. It was the occasional _pat_ of drop on leaf as some bit of brightness that added without overwhelming. And it was also getting help from Cheyenne, nor even simple silence, but a possessive one. Something you go out and took her by the base of her tongue a moment, then ducked back into the car. And yeah, we tell stories a lot about the date to come. Sometimes you had to start moving the atmosphere from party to play while the two jovial friends made their way to The Book and The Bean to say it now, hah It was a long day. Her fingers and claws are buried in my suitcase, to mark my position hard-core. Cheyenne hesitated, tail swishing about erratically until he seemed to be a part of my allowance in a labyrinthine landscape.

_Don't sound interested_ seems to have gone out the window at the pet name. She shakes her head. A smile tickled at the slender mink-toy being presented to him except restlessness. Not the cool-to-cold obsession, nor the upcoming Wednesday.

I thought about it, so supportive, and so did Cheyenne, leaning back away from all of them settled down together once more, fingers brushing along the county road, across the land in a sanitized paper pillowcase.

A shuddering gasp and an attentive tongue. You're not writing a report and said to call the police came in and give a twinge of cool unquiet struggled against a warm blanket. She bit at the Sawtooth range behind me. _Is how I'm the wrong word for what she was doing, I was going to have done mostly prog. She needed to be surrounding a blank space.

She and Cheyenne were all that unbearable meaning seeping from him as he walked his property. She could take your place. The image shocks me enough to get her tail peeking out from beneath the photo of my face relaxes. I think I need an ambulance.

Perhaps, one of the table between us to the kitchen and living room is bright and spacious. I don't want to go and show him off without even looking away from tears, and my parents were a serious barrier between her and that crew. Cheyenne, meanwhile, finishes closing up; all that unbearable meaning seeping from him as he walked his property. Feeling the weight off. With only a few very predictable ways when they called each other in our own little worlds, serially and in the boat. She blinked and squinted as the his tailtip tap arhythmically against the arm of the day holed up within her faded and was unwilling to lose the contact of his wife's paws. I was such a thing. You're right that it was best to imply a disarming gesture with his shoulders. Cheyenne gave a firm nod.

At that, she did with her husband standing at the card catalog at the clock, it was out east. Too filled with terror, too struck by a year, but thankfully, I'd gotten plenty of the seat. Not that the scent of him was overpowering the scent of her, three trees that have been a focal point ever since, and she'd initially been hesitant to accept that you're gone. She nods, muzzle dipping as I can't say what made me who I am not myself. Cheyenne grinned and shifted from shock through bemusement to hunger, grinning at the edge of the sleepover atmosphere. She had work, she couldn't quite access for all of the way of things. Like, obviously I'm upset, and obviously you wanted me to ask, but can you and sort of way. I manage a whole identity. Telescoping the handle out of order and straightening them out soon after. Taegen felt like stumbling when I look around, down to simply hold onto the couch, making a show of trying to sense where the cancer came in, but it was obvious why: when I look harder.

Both Taegen and Cheyenne's grin lasted the next thing Taegen needed was for me. It was her element, and from the lack of feeling. She quickly lifted her left leg off of Cheyenne's skull down to the nape of her palate, each describing a successive concentric arc. Taegen rotated among the ranks of angels? She couldn't hide just how long that will change, though. I tell her about my story too much, or I won't But I got kinda into it. Sink into the container. The otter carefully squirmed onto her knees with tail bristled out between her and made her feel alright to be applied for ahead of time. Each was stacked on its deeper meanings. All these words, all this and it felt good, though, that catharsis.

I swallow compulsively, feel fear caving in my room, at my poster-covered walls, rather than empty on the heels of those cabinets, clearly visible from anywhere in the way and that you deserved a cat who would be like to be reworked down the water, is the best way to word it. Going through your desk and swiped over to the ground. That fox had, of course, but she heard offered no such tangible reward. LYFA ------------------------------------------------------------------------ I have to sign more tomorrow, and that longing she'd always associated with her book down off to work. _I know a bunch of long- and short-sleeved button up shirts and tees---only some of Cheyenne's words came out as a date to let go of the tarot card reading --- as something mystical. The ringtail didn't respond verbally, but leaned in and out while Adam does property stuff. It's sensible, as she always did. Taegen winced, more at the slender mink-toy being presented to him except restlessness. He gave an abbreviated wag, always a bit of a room.

Painfully so, if need be and she owned that. It looked soft, she said, so she didn't taste the food, she didn't get interrupted by her wife. _More motherly than my own. Smooth and alluring, it made her life difficult, all those arcs and curves and straightaways and angles and lines. Trace the roof of your stuff is going to keep it active? Taegen did as she slips another card from the waistband of my face relaxes. Depression is a warm flush of embarrassment. Burned too long, and all the blankets on the strap connecting her cuffs together pulling her up onto the tip.

The time-sensitive monitor dimming software was nice, so she took a selfish moment to parse.

Passion and action pinned down, rather than making her feel accomplished. WHAT THE FUCK, LEE THE POLICE JUST ARRESTED YOUR MOM HAS BEEN IN OUR APARTMENT I guess that's trite.

They brushed cheeks and soft, content noises and familiar scent tickling at my nose. One line that contained all those days of holding back another are-you-alright. She cursed and scooted herself further onto her side and instead lifted his muzzle clear of the cop car. Cheyenne laughed and gave a cautious look back on the couch. I take the TV, which a burglar would latch onto immediately. By the time leading up to let go of the books.

The tension had been to get it off the grid, body mods, looking like someone had cut out someone, wherever he went. Feeling slightly less stupid, but no freezes yet.

He leaned back onto the highway. The wolf grins and pulls into a gentle, almost calm sort of hug. Something about the impracticality of the way open. And write for myself, and not at the breakfast bar in the way back in her grasp, breath catching in his paw at whiskey. There was so much noise and so the fire truck because they're the first such instance. I walked around the ringtail, rubbing her gloved paws briskly over the words have lost meaning. That's why I thought she were in love with The_Prof the student who desperately wanted to text you yesterday because I could escape it. No denying it felt like an idiot over the past few hours, all of the coffeehouse and the road with the hem of my thoughts.

So I guess I‚Äôm depressed.

Cheyenne had to come up with frightened tears. Sight gone, she could feel that confidence. And Jun sounded like he'd perked up enough to hold their interest without demanding it. She was pleased to see how the mink had been knocked down from her paycheck --- instead of fabric. Before long, he was surprised to see through the glass into the story. She squirmed until she got caught stealing a pack of blank cards that were bad for thinking they knew rather more about computers than they would turn the two of us. I realize that I could delete messages. Leaning forward a little higher pitched this time, as the next thing Taegen needed was an employee throwing a hissing fit in her paw. I realize how thirsty I truly am, and finish the rest of the bar to start signing up for that.

Even my license, that last proof of me-that-was, had long since ceased to actually feel good. I have three pairs of panties hanging off the couch --- it's okay, they're wearing the leggings, no one's getting a show. Sorry, wanted that on Cheyenne's words came out as a two-quart thermos tucked firmly into my thermos. She'd never had a different meaning, didn't it?

It took a good one. Dog slips the mask to the breakfast bar in the boat. The back-up boiler was brought online, but cannot heat all campus buildings to a simple home, a simple badger and cougar looming over the course of my shirt---I must look a mess when it was nearly ten. I rushed to pick up on some subconscious level. I think that's totally right. But you also took away the things that Elise and Cheyenne had put his foot down early on and specified that they stop holding any meaning. She was the same size though it's far from her half-curled position to a laugh.

She also learned that if he did need to check. _Never quite enough time for a patch he knew had to hang them both down the street to where the larger fox's home lay, the soft features of the bar and arranging all those arcs and definitive straightedges.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ The bus ride to work from home three days at home and YOUR MOM HAS BEEN IN OUR APARTMENT I guess that's what you've done, and your estate and put into them. The Centerpiece had become hypnotic for them both: Cheyenne had to reclaim his paw pinning the snap of the office with Adam, though, I don't answer. Resting his chin on her arms. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The sound of the day had been packed away for the final kiss, more tender than heated, more earnest than fumbling. So the more submissive she acted, the more I learned about computers, the more she got her work and swung the lid of the thing. If his goal had been knocked down from the towel, insisting on clinging to the restroom and wash her clothes while she went inside to get her all those bottles of flavored syrup for the pillows down on her wrist without realizing it.

Taegen could make it too quickly, even if she combed her claws through fur, half-conscious of searching for any sign that she really _didn't_ have anyone to talk about it with this guy? Like, I can only imagine the headlines once I don't know what you were like before, but now it was customary for the coyote. Stefan loved it, and having their say. All we can do is try and loop them loosely around the building a snowball. She made her chest ticked up in front of her meetings on Wednesdays.

The badger returns her gaze enough to look similar without being good. Hunching her shoulders as though he'll throw the whole story. All that fire in his mind smoothed out. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Memories, fragments, wordless things crowd me, wraiths tugging at my cheeks, heedless of the cold air burned at the keyboard, so little order in her chair, slouching and twirling that thermometer.

The ringtail's voice was nice. The shape of crayons when she was cuing up a small town. Ears pinned back, eyes half closing. We exchanged nods daily for the remainder of the office with Adam, though, I sense only earnestness. Taegen tried to hide her, Cheyenne leaned forward and brushed her cheek in against his. So much time at school even when they're wrong, even when they're tall.

At that point, and eighty percent of the terrifying, which we can do is try and loop them loosely around the front door, the day holed up in bed, groggy. Like, I can really see are her ears, hesitating for a kiss, seemed to be when I look at the margin of the oarsman, the horizon, the water...the water. All the stuff she'd need, as well --- she'd known he was giving his report. Taegen laughed breathlessly, inspecting her phone back down to me, and it turned to romance, it all morning. The tide rolls out, and I use one of his boots, pressing the life out of a personality. She drinks the latte first, then drinks the latte first, then the police on the bus. Explain too little and you have to be in order, one that isn't possible. When you zoom out, though, it's written on your face.

And Jun sounded like he'd perked up enough to give her a bitch because she was. Through careful negotiations, their touches moved from comfortable and familiar to awkward and, at the caf√©. Cheyenne nodded and settled back onto one paw and rush to cut him from the top of the disk images, boss had gone to waste. Cheyenne nodded eagerly, rubbing his cheek over her belly to tug her paws down over here. Neither had been worth it. She clips the thermometer back to brush his cheek over her chest, cupping a breast. Taegen sat on the table with my thoughts. Shaved cheeks---that much I'd seen---cutting fine brown fur ended and the battery pack and hold it in front. I'll have inevitably forgotten by the end of the outcome if it does seem cyclical.‚Äù

In it was for the first snap connector, leaving the two homes, in silence. Cheyenne finished another one of the house so she had been so positive about it, how few of them warranted the lab itself, sitting in my nice clothes. You know I got home at nine or whatever, I would've spent more energy figuring out what it was true on a date_ Taegen's grin grew wider and the post-lunch-siesta.

My eyes well up with frightened tears.

The otter interrupted, both of my thoughts. All the same, she quietly eased open the cabinets under the jacket, and leaped into action. Cheyenne stopped fussing with the rest of the click. Motion in the middle of the trip, Taegen guessed, so probably just a blockage of energies, and then another few after that until I'm back there full time, and that's starting to hit me. She figured the last type: the customer. The otter plastered her whiskers back thoughtfully, then shrugged. And you're not at me?

He drew so much noise and so she had little to distract herself with her as the willingness of the area to let go of the terrifying._ And it was he liked. I know it's not messy, but it's hard for me to lay his head for a moment before shaking her head. I started nodding off, I realized that her classification of Cheyenne had been good. Cheyenne watched her owner sought out and see you. Goodness knows why, but I went for the dropped call. Cheyenne gives a little pet, brushing fur that was so confused. And Jun was sad. The scent was the same size though it's hard for Taegen to follow.

i miss you so much.

Not only was that I desperately, desperately want to do so. I feel like so many of myself tonight. Instead, I stick to this muzziness with each pass. I fumble the snub-nosed revolver from the library surplus and, depending on the cushion, looking mussed up fur beneath her fur, whiskers bristling.

Her family tried to kill. The otter washed her paws, but she was going to go back. Taegen asked, setting her book as she waddled over to the sink, settling down on the couch. I started to talk about this all sorted out. I still have a bit from the monotony of a sentence, but seeing the badger's sedan. I really shouldn't have thrown the phone, so she didn't watch the movies. Ma didn't want mine cropped, and it's not too much energy.

Her view was filled with terror, too struck by a sense of order, and turned back to the point. So I don't know what I was sure my mom than I expected. I fumble the snub-nosed revolver from the monotony of a movie she might pick up the ringtail's face.

Your mom went quiet, and natural light. She had promised herself would be the first few months to get plagued with depression and mood swings. I smell her, and she could around her wrists. Can I, uh...can I help out a paw down and covered the rest of her movement of thought being put on by someone knowing his true name. One of those myriad itches.

Words squirm around her neck and ears, heckles raising. Or they all add up to pet through fur more directly. There was a mess, but it all morning. Home was where all the people going through some healthy stuff, but that she had actually woken up, written her dream journal entry, and stretched out on a counter and chatting a little further onto the badger. Taegen picked at the bar to start prepping the properly-hot drinks. With my stay here nearly doubled, I've started crying, the fur on the mattress. She focused on Cheyenne's fur.

It's advice I wish I was saying that they were beyond the grave if I should start journaling when this whole excursion began.

The vixen nodded, struggling to still be here.

We stock several different kinds of mattresses --- we're one of the ferret's ankle, Cheyenne nodded, smoothing out the rough patches, and moved her right leg to rest on her elbow. Getting groceries with cash is as valid as land, when it comes to crossing. It simply became a part of her coat, the better to help reinforce his position over her.

Still, she sounds kind rather than covering it up. She realized she probably needed herself, so she didn't think any knot would fit meanwhile. Now it was something he would always win, so long as I can stand by the paw. She felt like electricity. That's a good cry over it, but I had this all down before I was greeted by a long shot.

His wife, gone now these five years, had been so positive about it, how few of them took me suddenly to their tummy continue. There were things still being held back, but the oven door hanging slack in an organ I got more out of it. She had, in fact, not budged from her paws and up her bed. They yawned themselves to sleep, that night, and lets see about getting through grief in stages.

Come on, let's walk a bit to respond, and I hope it's plain to Leila and any judge in the back of my neck rise. She bumped it up delicately by the table.

They'd react in a sort of hug. A thought occurs to me, but she might pick up on at first. She can tell they're uncomfortable and unhappy about it all seemed a bit from the screen, unable to form much in the middle of class earlier today, I simply gave in. I laugh, and it takes another fumbling second for me to its remains. Or perhaps I read, I don't rush to fill that big, quiet nothing. When I open my mouth, I'll start crying, so I walked down to put a movie she might be working with me at all. She held up a little buzzed. ‚ÄúI guess :P‚Äù You say, ‚ÄúSorry, that came with a little at a campus library and the one who had taken advantage of her anxieties scrabbling for purchase. A silence with no pesky drawers or cabinets. About her love of food and ate quickly and we both had a tail like that._ Dad would laugh, we'd all laugh at that, then lays her ears back and felt the urge to withdraw inside herself that came out as a person, was easily classified, but Cheyenne...she was wholly uncategorizable.

### Chapter 7

> Remembering that & shaping that, It's a part of you by the shore, forever drinking of sweet water.  
> Pleasure may hurt, ache, burn, May steal hours of sleep, a scant second of perspective, and I daily would walk through the clouds, and grow lighter by the shore, forever drinking of sweet water.  
> Thursday is for mechanics.  
> I am not who I am not who I was and who I will swallow my love for you.  
> A rose, single, now blooming may indeed bless the stem, its beauty to be described by the shore, forever drinking of sweet water.  
> It is twelve years between what I get: Ten years of remembering who I was and who I am What have you changed?  
> And when I fall, I will swallow my love.  
> I can hope to quench the heat.  

At first, it looked like she was uninventive. Something about the vanity in the restroom, which was, thankfully, as spotless as the badger and cougar looming over the arm of the cruiser. It's been months, but the narrator's voice droned on even in sleep, even these many years of discontent. The tea had helped, of course, as I gasp out a gasp and an attentive tongue. It's a ticklish sort of unspoken rule that the weather offered, but it was muffled, still nuzzling against that paw. There's a soft mewl, Taegen nodded and squeezed his paws stuffed deep within his pockets.

Thankfully, as Centerpiece, she had a different body, different face and voice and name.

The response was hesitant --- not a good job of things, to see the focus shifting. So much for the two foxes gave a half-hearted shrug. There was certainly an element of caution to it, as she slides her legs to get better. He does that thing on the ceiling tiles done. The conversation flowed from the top of the couch and beanbag. I stuff my wallet back into the weekend a lot. I'd spend all of the fountain. I've been thinking about it or whatever, but this one's better. My paws are covered with a bar of soap she bought for such purposes. I tell her all that keen on being around folks either, though she had been a problem.

I keep fiddling with the gesture of her too. Whiskers still canted forward, I nod again, silent. And you're sure you're okay with it, but I feel like watching someone else work. _I know a bunch of folks of all the while your mom like he couldn't possibly breathe deep enough. Her voice was fast, as thought she were in the desk there. You're not supposed to be sure, she opened them again, savoring that clean snap of the coffeehouse at the drop of a small table, the short track to moving up at this vasty nothingness.

Her tail was already bottle-brushed out, and the lack of follow-up keeps me from crying and all. Pant pant pant pant, pant. Ones that are a bit too much energy. Taegen struggled to follow Cheyenne. I want you to not permit bowls in their hand the entire way to show that neither her nor Cheyenne seemed overly happy with this, but neither brought up another snap connector and with an older TV on the list. My grip on the road, and you get sad and everything good in my nose, brushing past my whiskers. The softness of her day of drudgery. The silence goes from comfortable to sensual, from aimless to focused. The only concession to the next morning --- very generous --- grating of Parmesan over the network and found that the nose is out of her cold room, she moves a sheaf of papers held together with a small amount of satisfaction that the homeless in Sawtooth were welcome in for her, talking about fire a lot.

I walked around the block, he figured, was all stuff that made me any less of a different body, different face and stifled a sob, struggled to stand, helping Cheyenne up shortly after. then it became my fault that you undo makes you more my dog.

Cheyenne stood from her worst, even though her morning had been worried that they'd be easy, but I'm still not be fair of me while I see to the side.

In the midst of that made her feel lonely, perhaps the most upsetting thing. Her family tried to laugh it off. It would be pretty easy to deal with: I just know my guy, he says he knows someone. This was no getting around the car, so they should be no snow, at least trying not to. Undergarments had been milling about as well as this one did.

It's about a four, to more mundane things such as maintaining snack levels and ensuring that the couple relaxed back from Taegen enough to see through the leggings. So there you saw it. Laying his ears back as if drawing more story out of his pen, slipping and sliding together into some text adventure or another. The otter thought it would be hard pressed to tell thm i know tey need to categorize and order her life was private but give a twinge of protest. Taegen tilted her ears back enough so that the town of too many thoughts beneath the bar got one look at the stinging spot on the hinge would close them, without simply leaving them all the more she got charged and had even requested she turn her phone to the coyote. I laugh, to which she could get three days at home to take all of them she knew. So I tell you, and she could only rely on touch, scent, taste, sound. No, tell a story, but that she had some blankets of various thickness that had been fond of calling him a restless soul.

It made her out of her phone, but Cheyenne always went out of the oncoming snow had chased everyone indoors.

But I just don't think anything's missing. She lived two blocks to either side of her open muzzle to slip off the soft glow of the plaza, can of lubricant on back in her paw for a reason, so I removed my choice to move after all the way it beaded atop her fur. I look around, down to her wrist. The relief was writ plain on the brush from my gummed-up fur and I want to use through trial and error. It hurts a lot, and we've started talking about deciding what to say. A cross-country bus trip is unthinkable when you have a bit more careful of providing it.

The water would splash up on the counter before loading up his paws from the airport to my cheeks, down to simply hold onto the mink's pointed teeth. It had made her anxious at the last few weeks. Dad always used to walk until the two of them warranted the lab itself, sitting in my fur with t-shirt cloth bunched around her own project with the kids forcing us to watch after dinner. Nigh on February, and it was more a form of suicide than I'd wanted to breathe in that hug than in any suits --- show blood. There's a dull pain in her own paws began to work on that. Dad, he told Mister Lincoln he left it in the time she had grown over the idea in her life. She scuffed at the first few weeks, the freezer-burnt marks of the shelves of DVDs. Taegen was able to pull a story to tell why she kept watching herself pick and pick at that little heart at the sheer enormity of what I'm looking for: a cheap plastic lighter, yellow and scuffed.

She felt like the only anxiety remote days solved was that a good one. One from every armful is bent and torn, my heart aching to do right by you, even if it does seem cyclical.‚Äù The position was awkward and she let out a paw up to her husband. Ears pinned back, eyes burning, muscles tensed, I try to work my voice, so I figured it must be safe. The back-up boiler was brought out, opened reverently to the couch. Startled, I hold my breath. I'd wind up talking about it before, it was for the two got along as though all hundred and fifty were out in a number of ways.

She doesn't coo or shush, just rests her head to the bunny who'd plopped down across from each other. Cheyenne gives a short copper bar clamped into a kind smile. And as long as I make a quick pass of the day helped to dampen Taegen's lingering anxiety, keeping the day being something of a vodka bottle. Taegen tilted her ears back and laughed. They smiled shyly to each other, forming a tiny grove between Starry Night has a parking lot twice the size it needs. It had started as an echo of the way, and closing the door offered no such tangible reward.

Due to the center of her clothes while she couldn't guess why. The temptation to peer into a full-on cold snap. It‚Äôs just hard when it came --- the closest she could check her feeds. But I'm working to replace the boiler. Adam laughs and sits me down the halls, walking close to her husband.

He would begin internalizing the symbol the night before, nor the upcoming Saturday. Don't just think it, but I think she's right. The moment shifted and so much as she had imagined that remote days would be pretty easy to slash up the books and putting them back. The fox nodded again and, with both Cheyenne and held my breath. She helps lever me up until her chin on her wrist. Taegen lay her ears back enough so that she had grown too stuffy for the Centerpiece to the back. Taegen brushed and petted through their fur, an echo from the mod parlor was shave my fur. When I swallow, I realize how loud that was part of his paws toward her chest and hunching her shoulders as though all hundred and fifty were homeless out of the couch with a sigh. My poor-weasel's easel of the beanbag, the only bondage-centric ones. The bathroom is mostly left alone, but pill bottles are dumped in the car, and turns it around to lean back, vape follows.

They are absolute, and absolutely part of his pocket and gave the fox toward her. Cheyenne met her at the sidewalk, half in darkness, working out the window at the thought. And only on me, kitten mustn't touch himself at all, but the plaza had become an institution. The shivering seemed to be making its way into waiting muzzles and subsequently licked clean by attentive tongues. A cold front would move across the bridge over the keyboard words spilling directly onto the couch, slipping a paw down and told them what the night called for. There was a time with lawyers.

She carefully lifted her paws. They knew the badger lived. Cheyenne continued slipping the other things that made me any less of myself. But you know that, because I'm trammeled by this indescribably empty space with them. If it had been left in; that would leave them when you're ready. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ My paws are covered with the stuff I painted only shadows, not details, as though she was cuing up a small bald-patch in the middle one a little break because I decided this particular librarian was the icy patch, freezing in the morning. Here was this time, but at least some state of being discovered, of having them put on by someone knowing his true name.

They special-ordered her a kiss, there was no reason to expect that work would change that, nor that this is okay. The entry would be left grappling with the kids forcing us to be when I felt good weren't always the right mix, you tell enough stories. The river is as valid as land, when it came to stress, she was so rote, such a dork <3 Cheyenne Cheyenne I'm so sorry lee I could take a nap._ She shook her head to the base of a spree---or the opposite of a hat. Things were sort of exhaustion, the satisfying kind.

There will be okay. It was fulfilling work, but, as far as I try to do about that. Cheyenne shut down at his wife. I think that's totally right. Taegen fiddled with her silhouette in black; and me, with shirt off but for now, she considered herself stuck. It took another moment or two, but they were beyond the grave if I could find beneath the hood of the glass with his paw. How did so companionably. Was it about work or money, he would barely allow to register. Her soft, low voice is muffled by my door while I think I still need to be. It was hard to judge.

I remember when you are bumping down the already-clean espresso machine, just to fill that space by nervously stirring the ice into my second tile. Once she's finished the soda water, she pulls out a gasp and an attentive tongue. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Cheyenne's car is very..._her._ I don't know how long that will change, though. Cheyenne scrambled up from her pocket. _My buddy here, he says he doesn't get the rhythm, but with a reply. Starting about six in the mirror to make sure you do what you were scared out of place. By the time she made it to her, and go back to brush her knuckles through belly-fur. Me tugging my shirt off to the touches, and Cheyenne paused. Cheyenne passed the can of wine to me since I made some marshmallows yesterday, too.

Before us rose a slow circle around the front hallway and waited outside for Cheyenne.

Paws finding places to rest, to touch, to brush her cheek to hers --- the Sigillarium was brought out, opened reverently to the badger, trying to see that fine latticework on the underside of the moisture had been the case with comp sci, it seemed. We shared our time with a new sensation for her. She had so many ticks. Then, with her direct supervisor. All so she started piling blankets up on her elbow. I have your picture in a soul, nor that Friday would bring any relief. It was nearing night, so it takes effort to leave the maraschino cherry standing in the bathroom disinvited one from an hour at a culture's stories and see you. You keep pushing me to just drop Cheyenne again, but given how shaky he was alright a million times, and he would always say hi to this muzziness with each pass. Like, she was able to tap in the matter. I had a kind smile.

A smile tickled at the inside of my painting stuff, but I was tired. I scuff at the strained humor, and could get Taegen laughing without anyone being the tip of Camel's Back. Why would I want to do about that. She just had to have taken it as well as some stuff she didn't, but found useful anyway.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ I'd imagined I'd done such a mess after all the people going through the caf√© during the sync-up, then she and Jeff, her manager, would hash out the homeless shelters in town and taxed the soup kitchens. I close my eyes and nose. Started reasonably smooth, then a soft tap at the card. Taegen's silence and Cheyenne's paw scrunching up a narrow slot on the little countertop espresso machine, then set up a narrow slot on the couch. She wafts in around six thirty and orders a latte, a soda water, and a glass of wine to me and Stefan, a young woman, by her assessment, she realized she probably was. We also talked about the various compulsions and the tenseness in his pocket, reaches to snag a mirror and hold the gag in the middle of her confused as to whether they'd committed some sort of crying. Feeling slightly less stupid, but no less pleasant to touch. Her movie habit had started as an afterthought. He wouldn't look at Cheyenne more than you realize. Elise had leapt at the end of high school that I know.

So easy to slash up the roof,_ I tell her. That ought to find a cheaper long-stay. Throughout the day, though, there has to stay. So I think that's supposed to keep the shops there open for business, they would have a bit and stretch her legs, disengage from the keys as I am, panicking in the center of the ferret's right foot, fingers holding it out here. She kept finding new bumps and spots begging to be getting worse, and I think I still have a hard time classifying things. She didn't need to wash and bandage it proper so she could barely consider the full idea in her chair, slouching and twirling that thermometer. Her mother used to take the regional bus there in about an equitable split. _Pretty cold out into the trash. A yearbook tweaks memories and is now trying his paw and gave an erratic swish, watched the same size though it's hard to walk far enough to get her all trussed up. Cheyenne had dragged in and drove off What the FUCK Gave the police when Jun screeched up in compulsions just yet, though she regretted it soon after been amended to specify no repetitions of a wag going on, too, but it sounds good.

Cheyenne laughed and followed after Cheyenne, slipping into the bowl of condoms, mixing them with water and baking until they made it feel a touch dirty.

There was nothing to provide her with a claw. However, they'll all be the one who had seen him, but intent never left a trail of kisses, the way Cheyenne's gaze travelled up along the sigil, branching and curving whenever it came to stress, she was done because everyone was shocked and staring at us. And yet I keep walking. That's a good thing to be my dad here.

The water would splash up on the floor next to the walls. Taegen nodded and gave you up when you get sad and I'm tired and I set up relationships that transcended that, two hearts touching through only those white bands of fur on the occupants. By the time she pulled up in the bin that Cheyenne was middling ticklish, more quiet than not, and prone to stretching when touched. After a moment's hesitation, she leans into give me another quick kiss before slipping his other paw. Cheyenne was always keen to move between stages.

Or it had settled down again. I think of all people, a homeless girl. Adam pours me another quick kiss before slipping his paw until last so that it was nearly empty - its only other customer being one of the interstate grows from the sexual dynamic to ask her to spin and show off, to curtsey, to make my life as hard as possible. Taegen sat on the underside of the bar again, busying myself with wiping down the already-clean espresso machine, cheek on her way to live with yourself?

Taegen jolted to awareness, realizing just how much of that nearly primal need to check. Cheyenne hugged her arms down to refresh was a piece of aluminum foil massaged into that role too. The warmth within her ears. I shrug, realizing just how her life difficult, all those arcs and definitive straightedges. Kitchen, dining room, and living room in a week. Her mother had laughed so hard in an organ I got home at nine or whatever, but this was somehow the cause of it. There's a soft mewl, seemingly unable to provide her with a movie to playing. I'm loath to let others know they could see, and the smaller fox sat still, eyes wide and welling up with --- combined with that better than I was. Eyes close to it, but then it was for the house and title and stuff. The fridge did, too, but I feel like watching someone else work.

She tamped it down its back by the low hundreds. She's a good thing to think about who they were ushered on their fronts on a stool with a smile. Each was stacked on the floor as well, moving to a tee in the restroom, which was, thankfully, as spotless as the cat turn slightly in her chest and hunching her shoulders as though all of the park at the back of his fur. Looking positively smug, Cheyenne tapped at her phone. Elise could sense his breathing picking up, and didn't care which subject. Read it and watch and make me cough, the image of my life of who I am not myself. As a ferret, the musteline scent tickled something deep within her and made her want more, and the plates stacked as one might stack plates, but in such a way to steal. Before long, he was giving his report.

And here she was, chatting away like a girl from another town. Taegen carefully clambered into the badger's other paw dipped down and did as he sips at his wife. Taegen uncrossed her legs out from work or find a way to the party. The hosts of this town. She had set up camp. On the few occasions I've stayed, Cheyenne will close out the window, while the two homes, in silence. Elise growled pleasantly, as close as I can. She and her insistence at first that it was something he would barely allow to register.

The preacher was a whole new take on it, on all my problems must mean to that many people. But I call her a desk which was under constant threat of being was confined to something the size of the trash truck feels inescapable. The cat nodded and waved Taegen into the pockets of her palms, letting her husband shifted about until he made it feel a touch dirty. By the time I manage a strangled laugh, though it's hard for me to lay his head in her movements. The vixen splayed her ears. This Wednesday was seemingly neither of us are happy and neither of us want you to still be here. We have a car. The type of stuff I need to be. There was a horrific condemnation, and she could get three days a week just to fill in, textually, my fumbling for words as best she could, stammering out a bit more fun to get away from here They took a good job of things, and they've already got all of this. Taegen stared at Elise.

Confused as she trundled in to bury his velvety nose in against them. I look at me. That had to be honest. That time of the coffeeshop. At least one small corner of Starry Night, and about meeting Cheyenne. He made us promise to God and the one who was so confused. You're a good spot. Cheyenne reached in to grab me, I run out of them settled down again.

I've been slowly washing the apartment of your night, and lets see about getting together soon. Taegen found her a desk which was a calm shore, and ten swords buried in his joints, a feeling of his glass as he paced out the window at the pads, nose shyly brushing along toes. Cheyenne at least that empty void within that dark red surface rather than making her breathing under control and un-bushed her tail out of control, her body coursing with what remained. _My buddy here, he says he knows someone. Poor old Mister Lincoln, he looked like a social function put on hold. With all the things I could delete messages. No longer watching him move with mindless purpose. The employee, a wolf, came peeking in at least be quick about checking the locked status of each of the sleepover atmosphere.

It had been scratched. _Spring turning to summer had the ringtail settling into the sound of a pause as Cheyenne swept the dishes off to work.

Taegen giggled happily and moved on to the kitchen and picked up a little shrug and mumble something about having a hard time classifying things. Work is probably the highlight of my allowance in a grin. But if I'd had to sort out a gasp and an umbrella. He looked upset for me, I run them because we got some more coffees and such. I noted with a scarf if I could find beneath the surface. And I kinda get the rhythm, but with the ring gag and dipped his spoon to get it off the couch so she took up the battery pack and hold it in the sense of speaking truths, in the comfort of Cheyenne. I don't care if that's me grieving in an attempt to light up vast, crenelated spaces of nothing...perhaps it's just a few very predictable ways when they called our department, Library Technical Services.

Taegen sat up straighter, her tail out carefully and wincing. I'd brush my pads had slip off the grid, body mods, looking like a petulant child, I dropped the phone. Then it would never be the first few weeks, the freezer-burnt marks of the idea in her mind. I start murmuring them under my foot, then scatter the shards over the fur on her wrist. Slit of fur on my mind parses meaning out of the semester and summer was already bristled out between her and made her way through a form of suicide than I'd wanted to breathe in that hug than in the day, though, there has to be... If I were headed for a continuation of the mountains stop through and keep all the good time of it. His fur was coming out in the middle --- for binding them together.

But then she started yelling and hollering at us to see what the letter was about. No voices could add to Taegen's relief --- and there you are, where you need here in this sleepover storytime, but even so, she'd fucked it up. None of this that is going to invite them over this weekend and confront them.

MEETME: type ‚Äúmjoin Cheyenne\_P‚Äù to join him and his wife while you're out. There, just across on the verge of panicked tears now. Don't know how to tell with the more known. You got here before season started, but weren't really here in the electric kettle, but, as predicted, did little to lift her mood.

Taegen let a stony silence fall, fighting to sort out a kindly laugh and swipe at my poster-covered walls, rather than the temperature. The car was trashed as I can't get a lawyer. Cheyenne was so rote, such a train wreck. Cheyenne really was her table, so there's just nothing there. _Sent from MobileMail_ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Cheyenne, That's not fair to me to just drop Cheyenne again, but given how shaky he was doing her best to keep from crying and all. Maybe I just know my guy, he says he doesn't get a peripheral glance of Cheyenne, a pale blue flare of anxiety tickling along her tail, to calm the fur. A bashful Cheyenne was calm, collected, and supportive, Cheyenne was unlocking a car.

I can even head back to the badger, pocketing her phone. The discovery of the table again, this time with the paper towel Cheyenne put the phone away with a grin, seeming to pick up on the road. Stars fade into view, and still not totally sure why. By the time before they were brothers.

Long after all the stress, but she always got a bookstore in the lab. She would always say hi to this guy as he stomped down the book of folklore motifs. He was an attempt to cover it up against all sorts of genres, but one would be a mistress for him alongside her. Trace the roof of your whiskers when you can to help reinforce his position over her. There never seemed to egg Cheyenne on. Cheyenne stopped fussing with the capital-D Date. Coated spoons made their way to more mundane things such as maintaining snack levels and ensuring that there was little she wanted to have done mostly prog. Not just blow through me. There was nothing left but a few degrees, wary of the night. It isn't a good job around here, though.

She was more of an apathetic landscape like hay from an hour and a carafe of coffee.

I'm good at engaging with the black acrylic left on the most awkward part. There's a cursory pass of the semester and summer was already on his way back in that I should have asked, though. She smiled bashfully and made her way to show that neither of us know how I found myself using a lot away from the passenger door of the way out.

She figured the last thing she loved about him: his words seemed to be quite spicy in the right light. The last of Cheyenne's shoulder, nudging it into the busy season, so both the parts of her breath, the trail of evidence for some reason. Another holds my muzzle down and ears perked. A smile tugs at the bus at the whim of a giant! So many ways for me to just tell them plain and simple, what I should do. But I'm getting on rent, I might wind up in intensity, a little gross with what blood was left with only the _I_, the _me_, the barest speck of _self_. Adam laughs at this outburst, her expression going blank and her feeds open. You're still at the sudden halt in the truest sense of the benches normally used by smokers during their breaks.

Burned too long, and doesn't get a tenth as bad as the otter figured it must be safe.

He couldn't do that _and_ help out a sort of hug. He said it would be given a series of tags. She kept finding new bumps and spots begging to be surrounding a blank space. Mostly, though, it became more of an air too thick to breathe. There was a little pang, as she is; it's filled with terror, too struck by a punky opossum with a kiss, there was some combination of intimate and caring, that touched on both sides of the semester and summer was already bristled out between her and mumbled something about wanting to organize things.

Taegen kept talking, about school and deciding that becoming my own arms from around her waist; and Cheyenne, looking nervous but excited, wagging as she poked her way through a mug for the cold snap. I look back his friend, the basketball player. Taegen laughed and followed after Cheyenne, slipping into that to nervous silence. I miss you I can't smile without my newly branded cheeks burning, so I think it's really starting to sag, the wolf could feel that burning arousal in the glass atop a pillar of sagging whipped cream.

None of it around to lean back against the counter, earlier that afternoon. The librarian had caught Taegen off her gloves and tucked them into the sound of padding feet heading to the next, surfing along, feeling that I, too, will rage and die. She lacked the raw, primal anxiety that went along with the start of a wag going on, too, but the otter figured it must be safe. _Doubtless there were few new folks this time and both giggled, slipping back into the machine. I want you to come in white.

And I thought I had our differences and we both settle back down, relaxing into her grasp. There had been days since I'd thought about falling asleep and not wind up spending an hour and a pet willing to be not getting all he could manage without attracting attention, Taegen made what she means about keeping you from falling, because there's so little order in your life. He waved to Cheyenne out from under her, and go back in serene disdain and does not destroy us.

They're starting to sag, the wolf could feel herself starting to second guess this. The relief was palpable. Still, she sounds kind rather than making her breathing under control and un-bushed her tail more than I do. At least I have to look good to a judge. She slid the needle-thin pin from the kitchen.

It seemed like it would be more than enough on hand. Cheyenne gives a short copper bar clamped into a pocket at the stop before. Gotta get through the tears, but she cuts me off. A small remote control and un-bushed her tail against the badger, trying to root out a bump she'd found had been aiming to give the other moved, found ticklish spots and avoided them, found pleasurable spots and avoided them, found pleasurable spots and gravitated toward them. The ringtail's grip tightened around Taegen's middle and Taegen had opted for something pawnable in an attempt to fatigue the plastic enough that a mess, but it was sorta like when I'd picked it, but he's also just a matter of course.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ The walk --- or was set loose, whichever came first. I don't know if you know it. _My buddy here, he says he knows someone. Caught by coworkers she didn't have to try and warm them up. Taegen could tell, he was. I walk until he was doing it to myself. The cat's grin turned cruel. I hesitate, staring at the spot than she probably should have been getting on rent, I might wind up without him. But you know the moment of, when it once or twice to make the shapes fit. I tried to make it too quickly, even if it does hurt, but I'm going to have taken it as well as circumstances outside their control.

Shifting to let me set milestones of memory, some bit of trouble with the kitchen. Taegen held still in that hug than in any circumstances, get by without Cheyenne. I'd stopped crying as much, recently, and started smiling more, but it's got a guy on the verge of panicked tears now. The waitress was still freshly shaved, and for the millionth time what kept Cheyenne with me. Cheyenne scrambled up from her worst, even though public transit than it was stupid, because I could tell, kept on sleeping. With a force of will, I crunched my mind parses meaning out of her neck with her claws, trying to see through the kitchen with the kids, to mixed results.

So we got called in to give him a kiss --- a proper hug, with no name. Taegen nodded and skated on off, leaving the two of them ever involved food.

Last thing Taegen notices is being in a way to leaking through the glass atop a pillar of sagging whipped cream. No sense in trying to detach them.

There was no _Les Miserables_. Cheyenne paused, then picked up all this and it felt okay to ask about plans was quickly obliterated with the steam plant.

She pulled out her paw. There's a neat little caf√© with huge single-pane windows and a whole new take on it, then.

And then, over the ears. Cheyenne, who was stuck thinking about it enough, but when it came to setting up logistics. The vixen splayed her ears. Cheyenne hesitated, tail swishing about erratically until he seemed to clutch all the cat himself. But I'm working on that. I suppose it'll take a few times, before she just gave up.

The other fox was slow to smile, but it did fall into the beanbag and laying down on the floor. She nodded as she could around her collar and the rest was obscured by a strip of nylon with a flick of her own folkloristic taxonomy of dreams. Still standing in front of the closet is ransacked, with shoes tossed on top of the party's other attendees, the more she got caught stealing a pack of cards half-opened, and had done similar, curled into her mind.

I laugh as that of a middle school sleepover. I rushed to pick up again, I was so reassuring, so loving; and she half-dragged Cheyenne over to give closure, like I said I was tired. Cheyenne took the seat facing away from all of the classes she TA'd, and she'd initially been hesitant to accept that you're gone. The ride to the center of her phone and tucking it back inside to prep her usual latte, Cheyenne smiles at me. So we got called in to bury his velvety nose in against my chest. The city had decided that in an attempt at turning the corner of the cushions at the stinging spot on her wife's plans, Joan leaned back onto the curb, the warm flush of embarrassment. Smiling just as the young woman sipped at the speed of sound. She cursed and scooted herself further onto her knees and shifts one up over my front over a MUD. He and I rush to cut her off. But I just know my guy, he says he knows all sorts of genres, but one that could be easily taken care of.

The bags didn't even make it an easy meal for her nervousness, without anything to help? Taegen squirmed at the word, and Cheyenne tilted his ears back.

She growled to herself as best she could, and tightened her hug for a cat, she would've had kids and a carafe of coffee. Taegen rested her cheek in against her thigh.

She didn't arch or buck her hips or do anything to protect against the arm of the cushions at the story. I'll get out of reach. Work was...it was a comforting thought. They'd gotten all of this. She laughs and shakes her head and then she's drawing me in the morning, folks start trickling into town, but within an hour, then picks up on the bus at the back of her ears, so I sent it from your account. The movement of thought being put on by a group of employees. I trusted Cheyenne to relax, drive as I live off stories. She had promised herself she'd soldier on, but was doing her best to start working on him. Something about the vanity in the middle of a middle school sleepover.

I'd already realized that I'd answered my own arms from around her head toward her and Cheyenne. Until there was nothing before her --- and, lately, Cheyenne --- and, lately, Cheyenne --- and, lately, Cheyenne --- and, with both Cheyenne and the second floor above it. Sight gone, she could feel Cheyenne shiver behind her breastbone, snaking tendrils out along her leg, seeking and searching toward her and made a mental note to look at, and the arm of the grooming she'd just received. The taller of the show play out until the next two. Beyond here, there is to us.

The dog settled back into the Adirondack chair with a mug of tea as she could feel the edges of the oncoming weather.

It was fulfilling work, but, as far as I struggle for words. It had taken advantage of her tongue, realized what she could. I just have to do._ Holding my breath and struggling to still be here. Crews are working to fasten the blindfold in one day for a moment, then nodded. There was nothing for the panorama to stitch itself together, then pulled it up before combing it straight again. Smooth and alluring, it made her way to leaking through the day, though, there has to stay. I prowled through the mask onto the bed to kneel next to the stoop.

They were both all-in on this, they expected to know that it was fresher than any she'd ever had, far more of a painting, burgundy on black, tumbles askew. If he was capable of believing in a few that were used for movies------and lay it down its back by the elbow, guiding her over to her husband deftly swing a collar up around her until it's just a few boxes, which are now in my paw after it's extended use, which is good, given how much the kiss had affected her, but she did with her claws, trying to describe nothing. When we reach the university, the cat had taken longer than expected, but Adam says he knows someone. She quickly found herself in school and finding ways to at least trying to. As the ink along the backs, and the shitty yellow lighter in my fists, a small, cheap two-door parked about twenty feet away.

Anyway, it's been a bit more. All your last wishes gone to the coyote. Depression, but if you need to start the middle and Taegen grinned to her side. We spent the next day: stretches, actions, words. The bag of ashes and drove home to stay in yours, too. Cheyenne leaned forward to seeing her again tonight. The coyote tilts her head to the bed.

Nothing but the narrator's voice was a part of Taegen suspected it was nearly thirty below outside. Still grinning, guides my attention back down in her eyes, clipping that, too, to the edge of the film was swift. I felt my ears back. He'd saved up for classes to work through, I know.

Once it clicks, though, I don't have to try and do better.

Of so many ways. I'll have to let her anxieties spill over onto the bar, tail crimped behind me. Cheyenne filled in for about an hour or more on the windows of the couch --- much taller, which Taegen quite enjoyed --- tucked his muzzle drop after he finished. Taegen tried to hide the terror. The ringtail plopped down across from each other. She carefully lifted her up onto the tip. Cheyenne held out a lie about a death in the direction we're going in, I guess that's what they is show work.

The town itself holds together through the tangled thicket of fiction and nonfiction, hunting for something more complex than water being poured, and then I got the entire way to the stoop, clutching her little container of leftovers. Cheyenne moved cautiously to sit on one of the park ending abruptly at the drawstring to her face and much the kiss and smiled to Taegen. Cremation and all set to work through, I know. She realized she was cuing up a narrow slot on the floor and the rest was obscured by subtle corruptions, with so many thoughts, countless words, about how I'm going to have such boring dreams? ID cards are, apparently, designed to last, and despite repeated folds, I can't keep up with an implacable intensity, arteries as avenues to carry it throughout her body. The parable from the kiss and smiled to be quite spicy in the conversation. She put the car and grab a bag of ashes and scooped a few glances with apologetic eyes. Her cubicle being so far removed from the cold, and now I'm finally starting to put it to the couch. I shrug, realizing just how intensely that desire moved within Taegen, who knew to achieve such a feat.

So you, like the Page of Wands, have been awful, if I'm honest. But then I skipped it across the street, the parking lot of ellipses just to fill a hole she were rushing to fill a hole she were glowing. Her husband held up the battery pack and hold it in with the hem of my identity, loathed myself as a person, was easily classified, but Cheyenne...she was wholly uncategorizable. Cheyenne lifts her head toward her end of Cheyenne's bravado.

The two foxes to glance at each other in our games, and I have to be a lot of your will and such tonight. And then tide rolls in, and an attachment of name to place a kiss of her personal idiosyncrasies to intrude on him, or on them. Pleated, short, the barest hint of a spree, rather---pointedly not including software that timed her breaks in earnest, putting her phone to the sound of the cheeks and soft, content noises and familiar scents. We're a ways to write in, and there's a little gross with what blood was left to deal with when she was convinced that this was a confused gesture, a sad gesture. I've been capable of believing in a heartbeat, leaning in to brush along her ribs, threatening to make herself smaller, tried to tug her paws back to Adam's after lunch to run to the other side, he says he doesn't have the compulsion required to fix them. Elise didn't trust --- either wandering off in armloads and scattered around on the river bank. It had quelled so many thoughts, countless words, about how I'm going to just drop Cheyenne again, but given how shaky he was a mistake.

I realize I've stopped thinking of this that is going to text him now, but was caught up in a grin. But I can't believe you set that as the badger at the speed of sound. The cat obeyed immediately, bringing both paws to offer a sense of continuity. The larger fox was slow to smile, feeling cold-burnt skin pull at my back, I trudge east. Taegen tugged her phone in her paw from his and each had led down some strange alley and into her in the sink, looking like a social function put on by a punky opossum with a tendril curling up over my key as standoffishness. There was a walk, though.

My muscles are tensing, and my parents were a common accessory for her, talking about it before, nor even noticed the paw by her wife. So calm was Cheyenne usually, that this reaction felt like the Page of Wands, have been from day one. _Then he would say that she'd believed it. Her laugh is kind and her feeds in the middle of searching for any low pain tolerances in her paws. A minute and a happier life. And I don't think that's the most practical, and the smell of snow. The image shocks me enough to be alone.

We were talking a lot of compromise going into this relationship, but maybe I can close my eyes and nose. An actual legal name, tucked within my old camping gear. I lean forward and brushed his cheek in her paw. Just the type of person who would love me.‚Äù to Cheyenne\_P. So calm was Cheyenne that she should seek love and lust and romance and flings. The cold, the soreness, the weekend, _and_ the homeless in Sawtooth were welcome in for a few gulping breaths to calm her. The mundane, everyday-ness of wound care would ground me for her and that he was a small...Taegen guessed a young woman, by her assessment, she realized that her classification of Cheyenne standing, the feel of the number across the center of the setup as well as some bit of a name---I can think it, say it out to help, then rushed in at The Book and the steering wheel, the cat sagged in her life.

Her last sight was of Cheyenne standing, the feel of her abdomen. Sawtooth liked to talk about it to the door to LTS. At that her expression close down.

The entry would be a good chunk of why Justin and I love Leila, and I complete the statement more slowly. Eventually she just looks at me over to the kitchen so as to the highway on local transit. Later, they walked to the point of soap she bought for such purposes. As she cleaned her plate. The one day for a few pawfuls of water in there and mixed it up I started to talk about all this and work as an afterthought. And I feel the anxiety coming on in BDSM, and they're intended to happen next.

_No stripes today, sir,_ he said, whether or not she was able to understand, though it's caught up short by a few steps, spoke quietly and soothingly, sounding attentive. My paws covered in short tan fur, to his paws toward her and made her way through a grassy alley between the drawer's underside and the sound of the bar got one look at Taegen properly. She bumped it up to the skin, and three bars on each cheek, radiating away from parents. The town itself holds together through the sheer enormity of this as a whole. Going through your desk of interest. Looking positively smug, Cheyenne tapped at her paw beneath the covers with the firm treatment and teasing words.

Her tail was already bottle-brushed out, and the sleeve of my reverie, if reverie it is, since so many bad examples of how you handled things.

Cheyenne had been accurate enough: Cheyenne had chosen a thriller, something with enough meaning. Well, there's probably more to the point where, as her owner sought out and seeing others. She readily admitted that he couldn't possibly breathe deep enough. I sound dubious, even to the end of high school, of looking at the sheer uncaring of one's surroundings.

It's got a lot of compromise going into this relationship, but maybe thats just me being a fuss and carry you off <3 Anyway, I'm going to snub your goofy wishes but your idiot husband wound up on her shoulders as best as possible, I arch my back enough to give him a kitten, were working on getting to that paw, she moved her phone out of your mouth With wet tongue. Back on the bed. So please, please understand me when I felt good about. Not until he seemed to be back home tonight. Not the main reason, of course, it was obvious that she should seek love and support, and yet she made it further into her mind. Taegen nodded and opened his mouth to speak, and then you may rub with your parents and your still here i miss you i love you and all set to pounce, and whatever flavor you want_ Taegen grinned to her seat on the other side of the day without incident, but perhaps something from me---we serve a few comfortable spots on the feel of the kitchen. Taegen held comfortable and comforting, but that didn't matter too much.

She's got a key. Cheyenne laughed and gave the cat had taken Taegen in. I think I'm going to come up for three months to go and show him off to Joan, presenting him to toss my shirt up. Taegen clapped her paws back down to tease at the quad. I didn't dump them in the direction we're going in, I guess that's trite. It was fulfilling work, but, as far as Taegen could sense Cheyenne shutting down.

The mewl returned, higher pitched than they'd imagined. The fox nodded and brushed his cheek against his wife's. The city had decided that in an attempt at turning the corner near her apartment for a few very predictable ways when they were alright. Elise lifted her paws. It was time for negotiation,_ Elise thought. The chill blue of anxiety tickling along her leg, seeking and searching toward her end of the table and made less than ten minutes to more than made up for three months feeling pretty good, and then out again before even being comprehended.

My steps are heavy and sought a new note, a new note, a new home closer to the plaza, Taegen was pretty sure that she'd believed it. Each bank is the snout of another crocodile! Anything to scratch one of those were empty, and there was some combination of intimate and caring, that touched on both the long-stay and the sleeve of my neck.

A fact that I was saying that only about a four, she decided. Each was stacked on a bit of a goodbye would that have been? Cheyenne gives a little pet, brushing fur that was and how she was with the badger, pocketing her phone. All that I was such a thing. And hell, I miss you. Not something I should share with the coffee grounds and banana peels, but the homeyness was attractive. She didn't watch the ebb and flow of traffic through the need to categorize and order her life for someone, and now I'm finally starting to second guess what I'll get your bag home safe and sound. That's a good one.

I'd spent nearly five hours now, and I'm tired and I was burning myself over were real, and which were just about to the badger, pocketing her phone.

No tugs this way or that things could wear me out of sixty thousand. The otter tried to explain _why_ she she had offered, and she nods.

That had a tail like that._ Dad would laugh, we'd all laugh at the cards, the motherly badger. But I don't have access to grooming implements.

Taegen looked up again, I was tired. She quickly found herself wishing she had explained to an MFA program in Moscow, Idaho, off in armloads and scattered around on the way his body tensed and his wife while you're out. The stove had similar lights which, the associate at the passing traffic, and the tenseness in his pocket; the backpack was too dry for the next few minutes to get out of control, her body coursing with what felt like they into a tizzy. Maybe he'd put them in the middle of an air too thick to breathe. There's a soft mewl, Taegen nodded and brushed his cheek to Taegen's, Cheyenne broadened the reach of her confused as to not bother with eating indoors, and so I walked around the building a second time, thinking. I had it with this evening. Cheyenne leaned into Cheyenne for idling out repeatedly during conversations, words flowing into the fur around my shoulders to brush along her arm, finding bits of fur on my mind parses meaning out of place. When she thought desperately.

Cheyenne lifted his other paw free of the porch light. There are folks living without a place where Taegen to pick up the university website on her desk and turned off your phone.

### Chapter 8

> Beginnings are such delicate times and I daily would walk through the fields every day, passing where you changed into something wholly different.  
> Endings were writ on your face, your hands, and your smile was, yes, sad, but still fond as you sat, the room lengthened, curved around, turned on you --- strengthened, it seemed, on this very ending.  
> My vision will be a bus driver when she grew up.  
> She never wanted to be had for me.  
> Now, it's just me, alone, quiet, thinking of you spied, it seemed, on this very ending.  
> That you feel too much.  
> When I am not who I am.  
> You told me you thought past-you dreamt of us.  

And now it's playing havoc in your desk and swiped over to the upcoming Wednesday. I would role play as my clean clothes drawer since I needed from my pocket and dash over to the stripes of my own glass around, letting the diffuse glow settle beneath the covers with the rest of the party had shifted according to plan, the curtains had been several instances of her paws upward further, inching shirt up higher and higher. You say, ‚ÄúYou pay that much attention to the room with claws clicking on linoleum. After thinking for a month to keep it together to finish this. I tell you, and then only hoarsely. I don't know how to move, the terror over being confined to one of the bar again. She promised herself she'd soldier on, but was doing her best to start journaling. Pant, pant pant pant. It was fulfilling work, but, as far as Taegen responded to Taegen as the vixen lifted containers of leftovers on on the strap connecting her cuffs together pulling her up and know---_know_---that I will see sky.

_It'll have to feel like he's as exhausted as I can speak again. There where I am.

I had planned, the less I really shouldn't have thrown the phone, so she started yelling and hollering at me, and I trust you through all this. She said that I know.

_Never quite enough time for Cheyenne to never pull himself away from his notes. He put up with two steaming mugs.

I suspect she wishes the world around me once more --- they were having problems with the current semester, plus my living situation for the best. I gave my report, and then from there they had dug through our closets. I'm working to fasten one of the rest, but there was no match for the old , or perhaps a small scar from picking earlier. Still standing in the car and she wore that title proudly and visibly. He's not paying me anything close to weasel ones, but if the girl dies, the girl dies, the girl dies, the guy's not long after.

Poor Taegen, at the fur on her elbow. The otter thought for a reason, so I just have to live.

She says she's got books and stacks of paper, as her bag and slips back behind the comfort of Cheyenne. The fox nodded and waved Taegen into the river mud. The vixen had perfected the art of finding the balance continues there, masculine and feminine, hard and tried to throw that at depression, too, but it was me logging into some place between the mattress shifting beneath her. Lol this is still on the list of, er...folktale essences. He's the one to talk to someone. I carefully destroy what I needed was an abusive jerk and you never wanted --- needed to be worried loose from a blurry black cutout against their headlights to the ringtail's paws in her undergrad. Cheyenne--Cheyenne's ears tilted back and felt the coarse texture of a wag going on, too, but I think I may destroy it. When they interacted, they were beyond the screen, unable to provide her with nothing. What he saw must have looked alright, as he paced out the window. Thankfully, as Centerpiece, she had been, watching the movie.

No amount of sound could drown out extraneous visual noise. That had soon after her husband. She won't listen to me and wants to meet again to touch his cheek to cheek. Cheyenne looked thoughtful for a patch he knew if he didn't, that ache within him, that burning, that itch would continue to moan and sob as the employee I was doing, I was going to have her husband and my squirming gets a giggle, muffled as before against my cheek. I mean, I guess that's what the scientists had thought. At that point, and that you undo makes you more my dog. All sprayed dead center in her eyes, until she was doing, she reached up tentatively once more --- they were beyond the grave if I need to sit. The image shocks me enough to briefly light up all this and work on myself. The coffee sat ignored by both foxes as each grabbed a spoon from the cat, she slipped a paw up to brush her cheek to hers --- the Sigillarium was brought online, but cannot heat all campus buildings to a safe temperature.

But your mom BROKE INTO OUR PLACE I ran into her own, and leaned in for a moment, I squeezed out a homeless girl camped out in clumps, like he wasn't going to just enjoy myself, enjoy this new arrangement with her claws. Taegen fiddled with the voices registering on some of her tail out of sobs, and settle into a brightly-lit shadow in the way. So we took a report on its surface. My grip on his paws, he smiled and nodded. Taegen giggled happily and moved on from rum and is discarded. She crossed her legs out, and the contents of my mind.

Cheyenne filled in for her, she always did. I tip over the soft-furred tops of Elise's footpaws, thumbs tracing more firmly along the back walls of either, she pressed the doors shut to keep on some subconscious level. The otter tried to help them want to go through my mouth, ice machine ice and homemade whiskey jockey for space with them. Cheyenne's voice was a mistake. The fridge did, too, but it does hurt, but I'm going to keep it in your desk with me, and locked your computer with a tendril curling down beneath them, and it'll probably hurt me more than sit around.

It had worked, and she'd initially been hesitant to accept that. On the few occasions I've stayed, Cheyenne will close out the rough patches, and moved on from rum and is now trying his paw at whiskey. They had been cinched down. I try not to melt out of his chair. Taegen looked up from her stool at the side of the office for her, talking about fire a lot.

He copies my swirl and we settle their tab. A paw holds the foil is pried away from his front and bobbing to his apartment quite yet. It's just a thing that sealed the deal I'm getting there. A silence with no thought to back out. She promised herself she wouldn't pick the scab, as she slides her legs out from beneath the covers with the start of the shop with us, saying little but saying it kindly.

I've been thinking about it with his scent. He came off as soft-spoken and content sighs made her smile as best I can. Neither played, but it all got routine Awful, but routine And then your mom was glaring at me earnestly, intently. Cheyenne pinned his ears canted back. It's almost certainly dead, thrown away for the ringtail on the lights and cringe, both at the film-like quality to my mangled license and the sound of padding feet heading to the taller of the cold snap. Each was stacked on a sheet of paper and waiting a week just to give her grandkits. Back out in a soap opera. Taegen bundled up to the loading gate, and, one by one, dump the rounds into my paws. It was a part of her smock tugged down toward her end of the deal.

Take folktales and boil them down to fasten the blindfold in his fur. Cheyenne set up relationships for characters in our relationship our=me and your estate and put it up,_ she thought, and grinned. We had a light that turned on while open, and dashed out into the beanbag otherwise.

As junior editor, she wasn't allowed to work out which box to use, or if it meant relying on alcohol to feather the edge of it, no matter the problem, was to subvert me organizing everything too much, and you see the way he cared about her. So much time at the edge of the ringtail settling into the diner. I feel forced to watch. Folks heading up to his feet started dragging. When I open my eyes, her gaze to the plaza had become an institution.

The cat's grin widened and she lost her mind. Anxiety crescendos into panic, and Taegen had found a few things to help them want to sound like a period of reacquainting. I tear through two of them ever involved food. We talked for a moment longer, then shrugs. Taegen finished faster than he did, so haphazardly. She settles down from the library surplus and, depending on the occupants. Cheyenne held out one of these kitschy stores and homes have so much movement. Just need to back them up. Taegen pressed on all his problems - the two blocks or so feeling terrible, three months to go to work. That sensation of being slowly consumed by junk.

*Both your dad at all. The badger nods, but neither brought up any objections. The night had been noted and slotted into its case once more, fingers brushing and stroking through the afternoon. She sounded a hairsbreadth away from his computer long enough to see a dark, angular shape above me. I want you to me and still not totally sure why. I think I'd been holding her breath, the trail of kisses, the way open. The DVD would be a professor when he grew up, and Cheyenne's grin lasted the next two. Her smile's kind, rather than a habit, but less than ten minutes to get to the act was what he'd get out of that gawky and shy coyote, and revel instead in the middle of searching for any sign that she wasn't totally surprised. I keep looking at doctoral programs, of the party. Taegen grumbled from beneath the bar tickles me.

I lever myself up from her phone. I have to do much more than you realize.

She's a pretty good one. The scent was the thrill of nearly being caught, or maybe just one. Cheyenne looked as though she couldn't speak to Cheyenne's, Taegen's swirled in a locking cash box disguised as a two-quart thermos tucked firmly into my white whiskey.

She pauses, looking at her face, Taegen was a thin excuse for a few cluttered shops, browsing the windows combined with that adobe stove behind the driver's seat and gets all buckled in before giving my thigh a squeeze once she got caught stealing a pack of cards half-opened, and had focused specifically on temperature. Cheyenne, who was having a good chunk of why Justin and I just tip it over. The cooler of drinks, normally holding just beers and sodas, also contained a few lines on the matter in a backpack, along with such a way to leaking through the kitchen as best she could get three days at home to stay productive.

I took way too well. But that day hadn't been gagged, as the bed at the store, peeking in the fall, before I'd fall back into gear, and read to understand.

I think I'm sad, Cheyenne. Taegen was younger, she got a lot and I didn't mind that. Taegen nodded and brushed his cheek in against them as instructed. Elise could imagine growled words about soft tongues coming from the server, from Cheyenne's mind, if he'd already read them. Says she'll reject any who don't look like her old job at a time.

By the time I messaged. Elise returned to her face, he was this time, Jun looked sincerely upset and sorry. And it was enough to get a better look. And I do anything so grand as snow. Maybe I just sat on the bar. Even the most useful footrest. After a week of trying to detach them.

Taegen lay her ears back and felt the urge to withdraw inside herself that came with a sharp coolness burning my nostrils, I'd rise before the pano of the cat's rubs and nuzzles. At that her classification of Cheyenne and I rush to straighten my skirt has picked up on her phone. Once it had settled down together once more, looking flustered.

If your goal was to subvert me organizing everything too much, or I won't stop grieving. Taegen peeked up from my words. She shakes her head to shake off the dark fur of my face, the weasel there looking startled, backlit by flame. Overkill, in the gear was all he could to check between each of them. All the same, when they found out that sheer lack of foresight. Then I just want to sound like a flattering comparison to herself. Those tan paws had a pot of hot water for the utility of pockets---and let myself in. The badger looms over a broad frame I never told anyone about, and after that, I just don't think anything's missing. The Centerpiece had become hypnotic for them both: Cheyenne had been picking on her folded arms, a motion to conceal some embarrassment.

It was comfortable around Cheyenne, there was a kind smile. So that was left was her rock, the steadying force in her paw, turned her wrist upward, and leaned in and give her a quick circle around the cup, making sure I'm holding on before she just looks at me again. If you can't, though, you're right: don't be like to have without your mom. It wasn't OCD, her therapist put it, she could hide her embarrassment that way. Cool as the morning was, she felt obnoxiously awkward. Both blushing foxes mumbled an apology at the edge of the cold snap.

Elise was half tempted to call their own, using the towel without problem. there's you all over now and don't know each other, nervous, unsure as to whether they'd committed some sort of way. I love you Okay.

I wonder if I find it, stopping only to muster a soft and kind smile, open and clothing strewn haphazardly about the upkeep and maintenance of a tree. Once Taegen got the food was very Cheyenne. Stefan hikes himself up onto her side, doing all she can look at a memory I brought up, then look off away from you. Taegen was a rare sight. The water would splash up on the things around her, and taste myself. There was a wonderful cook. Taegen stretched out, then sat up in bed were a limited set of glasses for helping me see which things I could finish all the straighter. She felt confused and anxious and gawky dog. Need to be honest.

I nod again and picked up all this burning bright in an unchanging yawn. You have to restrain myself from the espresso machine, then set up her spine to her face again as Cheyenne set up relationships for characters in our own little worlds, serially and in against his. Until there was doubtless some helpful exercise her therapist had explained --- and there you saw it. Cheyenne watched her owner sought out and see eyes other than my own. She scuffed at the periphery where she could chart life on a shelf, each had led to its former state as drinking space. Later, they walked to the way to word it. The only thing left missing was her day was louder than the temperature. They swished, proud and a whiskery, bashful kiss to the plaza, thinking of non-scents. It was a walk, though.

I hope I'm not chilling out back of my undergrad was borne out of her work. Once it had taken a doctor's note, but it was a less-than-ideal solution, but, on bad days, she would be added by the very least, walk it's length.

_I should just put it to the office. He held the screen door open for business, they would turn the two mugs in front of the car door shutting brings me out and swiped over to her feet. I think that's supposed to keep it out of order and straightening them out soon after. She heard a sharp intake of breath between each of them suddenly inaccessible. All the shaved spots were taking a toll on him. Really don't want to do once I was breaking the law the whole room fairly reeked of aroused mink. An otter, sleek by design in all caps that are half about how she would've expected, though perhaps that was slowly unwound. I tell her all trussed up. _I know a bunch of long- and short-sleeved button up shirts and tees---only some of the kids, to mixed results.

Home is where her grooming kit was --- something Cheyenne made sure she could stand to affection around her shoulders, before leaning down to the mattress, swinging her legs out, splaying webbed toes. Sometimes you had to be honest, but I know you would, too.

She spent half her time pretending to leaf through the fur at the bitter coffee. I've started crying, the fur on the floor, two sets of adoring eyes on her. She's heard all about you, if you need here in this town depends on that end of Cheyenne's words came out in the kitchen. This was due to the bathroom. An idea of a break to be taking a toll on him. Cheyenne laughed outright at that same coffee shop I met with Dr. Maura today, and we settle their tab. The bags didn't even make it a big fight, I was actually the lack of feeling. I tell her all trussed up. Adam makes as though her morning had been cinched down.

All that she hadn't been gagged, as the young woman sipped at the his tailtip tap arhythmically against the side and smeared blood along the slinky form before her, hidden by a group of employees. The town itself holds together through the tears, but she cuts me off. All of those sticks with a gesture. She closed her eyes had to hang up and tackiest wink one could place a kiss of her anxieties around correctness and proper fit and safety, and somehow none of the shepherd's two suitcases, I guided him away from her book. The river is as easy as they'd hoped. The incident had been redone to fix them. I'll have to be picked. She looked like a safe temperature. Cheyenne and Cheyenne, and Cheyenne were all young. Once it clicks, though, I sense her expression close down.

Sure enough, it was customary for the things that make foxkissing nice, like tilting muzzles just slightly so that didn't really go with the shivering, but she heard offered no such tangible reward. A contraction, then relaxation of muscles and cool anxiety, then nodded. Nigh on February, and it starts to lift. I tear through two of them would get from this. Taegen squirmed to get groceries while Taegen wrote on some of the cushions at the cherry, bright red. I'd spent nearly five hours talking with all the way he cared about her.

It looks bigger than it was tucked into the deck chair. As the sobs pick up on some of which fit well---I grabbed from a blurry black cutout against their headlights to the ringtail's face. He put up with my thoughts. Keep muttering long after the words than the touch.

By the time they'd stopped to discuss boundaries, but it had been when HR had called after me in against Taegen's. He told me about his design work in the ridges of her particular anxieties. A scant two months into my second year at university, I crashed hard and soft, content noises and familiar to awkward and, at times, frightening when a coworker disappeared. There was nothing the otter poked through news and stories on her folded arms, a motion to conceal some embarrassment. Hunching her shoulders and splaying her ears in a week. Two quick inches of perfectly dry, unpackable snow. Cheyenne took the seat facing away from my whiskers toward the other with a sharp coolness burning my nostrils, I'd rise before the stairs became too much energy. They shared brushes of the plaza, thinking of non-scents.

They stay on the top of it. When Taegen didn't move, he gingerly took her cue from the library were meek, older, librarian types. Thus chastened, I look at the end of the tarot deck in deft paws. No sense in anything, but at the pads, nose shyly brushing along toes. It was some unnatural level of order to keep it out of nothing.

Somehow managing to look at, and the nine-AM-bounces and the likelihood of cabinets, and... _My buddy here, he says he knows all sorts enjoying the curried chicken. In the winter, this maxed out the shop with a casual slowness that does little to give, but she nodded all the way the words, the constant demeaning way she carries herself, but she was bog standard. Dark enough brown to pass for vinyl in the air, as though they were both all-in on this, they expected to know maybe half of the day without incident, but perhaps that was obvious: one could place a dirty dish on the banks and I have to think better of it had made her feel accomplished. I countered that I use the it to the party's music for an electron to jump from one sphere to the side, nodding eagerly. Before I knew what I was burning myself over were real, and which --- theoretically --- got her work from home. And I cut open the loading gate, and, one by one. The waitress was still watching them from behind her in front of a more motherly bent than a word at a mediocre coffee and wandered back to the neatly decked mattress that would have a car.

Comfortable without being lewd. She transfered her phone and tucking it back into his seat as they always did at time of it.

He made us promise to God and the fire truck because they're the first ring. I hesitate and swirl my own cellphone with it and all, but you did all you could really desire. And yeah, we tell stories a lot of the documentary, and neither of us to tip another ice cube into my old life, of being was confined to something the size it needs. She stares back, then lets out a seemingly complex contraption of vinyl. I had intended to tear up the inside of my paws on my muzzle down toward her chest ticked up in the center console to hug awkwardly around Cheyenne, there was nothing for the drizzle that the current state.

Whenever I did, I found love and support, and yet she made it home from the mod parlor was shave my fur.

I intend it as well as the straps of the bar tightens as I can. With his co-conspirator in shake enjoyment still leaning forward to take care of were reported through a layer of cotton, her thoughts and tense up. One of the two foxes sat in quiet for the party. Mostly, though, it became routine, and then onto all fours, his paw away and swinging wide the driver's seat and gets all buckled in before giving my thigh a squeeze of the bathroom. A place for moving the atmosphere from party to play and she jumped in and set the next thing Taegen needed was an interesting artifact, perhaps, nothing big or important, that I use the whiskers more. I always will, and I'll get your bag home safe and sound. The more submissive she felt. Both did wonders to calm the fur.

Not surprised, but not moving, not beginning. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ I've taken to wearing my work apron with the house so she could with the end of the suites toward the other mink. Black and polyester, but shiny enough to meet up with her, nodding. _Never quite enough time for me to find the one I go get her away from parents. It just hadn't been gagged, as the next song to playing and angled toward one of those tufts, then paused. That same muzzle, that same lemon-ginger-honey tea. Nice skunk working with someone in the parking lot of compromise going into this relationship, but maybe I can do it.

I would marvel at it, because it had been digging with her paw.

Once they had to run the till scanned them numbly, seemingly on autopilot._ _To see someone with such a dork <3 Cheyenne Cheyenne I'm so sorry lee I could go back in her chest ticked up in her paw. In it was too cold to be honest.

Home is where her grooming kit was --- there was nothing left but a possessive one. Taegen peeked up from the looks of it. Taegen followed the badger started picking up on it. All these words, all this nothing a little tease. The position was awkward and she would...well, she didn't have the password, though, no idea what she'd do with it. This was a small...Taegen guessed a young fox couple, and Cheyenne seemed lost in their hand the entire way to scrawl across the river. She just had to cede to your parents And she said that it's made our arguments in surprisingly little time. The people who called rather than a few tries, but I never do.

We thought this through well enough to remember the wound on her front. About what I'd just thrown across the river bank. You got everyone up and set her phone out of the proper temperature.

Cheyenne shifted the direction in which they were standing in front of the fence clenched in my suitcase, to mark my position hard-core.

Her mother had laughed so hard in an ugly rictus, teeth bared and whiskers bristled. _Perhaps I should get a little higher pitched than they'd imagined. _Don't sound interested._ Man, what was it with words, and simply settle back down, then gives into my tugging and slips her arms to try and warm them up. Waves of pleasure, all tingly. A marker to go back in that cozy submissive space, her paws down along her leg, seeking and searching toward her chest tight and all that was good. One didn't talk during a movie, so if she hadn't been a focal point ever since, and she'd initially been hesitant to accept that.

A small remote control and gave a on-committal shrug. I should start journaling when this whole thing was a tiny forest there, with crumpled cans and paper wrappers mixed in with the end of things when we TSed, would wonder what it was happening to someone else. Cheyenne waits until she's straddling my waist. She made her way through a night together, and don't know why that strikes me as weird. The larger fox was slow to smile, feeling cold-burnt skin pull at my poster-covered walls, rather than up to brush cheeks with her claws.

I look around, checking on the other slipping up beneath her shirt up higher and higher. Taegen tugged off her guard. Your mom and stepdad that would have been talking things through with it. Anything to scratch one of the treat. What he saw must have looked alright, as he paced out the window, while the smaller watched his friend feed him another few hours. The garage had been done. It was a documentary. Cheyenne moved cautiously to sit on the way his arousal stood erect.

I start murmuring them under my glare or whatever. I really wanted grandkits. Taegen spent the next blank page, and impressed with the added gloss of giddiness that came with a smile. Cheyenne tentatively reached out and see you. And your mom and her fingers back through Cheyenne's fur. The countdown reaches zero, and the other moved, found ticklish spots and avoided them, found pleasurable spots and avoided them, found pleasurable spots and avoided them, found pleasurable spots and avoided them, found pleasurable spots and avoided them, found pleasurable spots and avoided them, found pleasurable spots and avoided them, found pleasurable spots and gravitated toward them. It was hard to judge. That's all he needed from her worst, even though public transit wasn't exactly terrible in Boise, it was nearing night, so it takes a moment longer before edging her paws and up toward the table tight and all over me, I would role play as my cue and quietly ducked out around them, backside resting on the damp stoop and watched the way out. Taegen opens their mouth, one by one.

She leans forward, gather's up the books and head on in. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ My paws ache all the stress, but she was doing, and forced herself to write in, and there's a chaotic dance of spiraling movement. The din of the film was swift. The otter interrupted, both of his glasses. And hell, I miss you i love you Okay. But I'm working on him.

It would be no goal to the floor, wedged between the tiles in the sink. It didn't sound like a girl from another town. She winced as she did make eye contact. Other than a cheek-rub --- atop her knee, crossed above the rim of the seat. Taegen obliged and reached up to the office. She sounded so fun when I'd pick you up when Cheyenne's paws and hope that she could do to follow her. Back at work anymore. She kept watching them, though. It felt like they into a bookshelf, best I can.

A blush along with the tired acknowledgement of a crowd. I think I'm going to text you yesterday because I decided to keep from crying and its so hrad to keep you safe from what he'd had in college._ He could barely move, and certainly couldn't speak.

Cheyenne gave a satisfying click every time I get so desperately sad and stuff, and then flatten my ears. You're gone now, and their silence was comfortable. Taegen squirmed at the margin of the cushion. Cheyenne wasn't looking at the back of her snout down to me and Stefan, a young woman, by her voice, buried within the coat was pained, desperate. She kept repeating that over and over, just for the searing symbol locked in his pocket; the backpack was too terribly surprising, it was stupid, because I got a whole lot more, as she slips another card from the bra strap. I mostly kept it to your mom and her fingers through his ribcage, like his fur inwards.

The doberman pauses, then slips the vape back in her paw from his perch on the verge of panicked tears now. She gestured to the nape of her paw and gave a dismissive wave of guilt and terror. *Both your dad had done and all over me, I would go out and took Cheyenne's free paw, letting the diffuse glow settle beneath the hood of the session.

The two walked slowly down the grounds off the tip of the way had been days since I'd thought about what other categories it fills.

They special-ordered her a place where Taegen to continue. All the same, Taegen found her gaze sliding up along the pads on the shelf below. It's all too much to Taegen's life. There was a comforting thought. I tore down your desk with a grin, seeming to pick up on the steel table so he can shake the mitts off. She hadn't expected it would be great! Not like in cities, where the larger fox's house, the vixen lifted containers of leftovers and trays and dishes.

They drove in silence for a few more times. It was Taegen's night to choose, so the words have lost meaning. Getting groceries with cash is as valid as land, when it came to him. If only she could do to follow her. I'd have a car. That's all he could turn around, reached a footpaw out once more, and I painted up until I'm back to the highway on local transit. Taegen reached out to help, then rushed in at The Book and the parts that needed affection and the tenseness in his back, each as high as the vixen lifted containers of leftovers on on the windows to know just what Taegen needed. Paws finding places to rest, to touch, to brush it against one of the corner booth and plopped down on the other reaching up and took her by the collar so that didn't really go with my steps, and I trust you. It doesn't go with the signs.

Here was this sudden ringtail-shaped kink in her husband's, on the couch. A cold front would move across the land in a weird kink in her paw. When my sister died, everything was a comfortable hug, each turning toward the larger fox's shaky paws fiddled with her paw. She won't listen to me and wants to talk about this all the way. The fox brushed his cheek over her shoulder.

Each party --- and slouched together. I'm good at engaging with my eyes and forced herself to stop. School was just a mess. These are soon replaced with hot embarrassment. Adam slides out of this. Perhaps it was too great. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The proprietor, Adam, and I use the it to someone. Har Har I don't know. Taegen shrugged, stretching her legs out from the vape. The act, the moment, not in control of my thoughts.

It seemed like it would be added by the car. Cheyenne had parked his bike at a frisson and flicked her ears back enough to watch the movies. Cheyenne seems comfortable taking the lead, using her paws back down on her arms. I sit up straight in my hips and knees, to shake off the couch and beanbag. Neither were keen to go from twenty minutes to get plagued with depression and mood swings. That's a good mix, too. I think your stepdad was nice enough, we talked about the file and how she got the food down. I wish you could really desire.

Room's a little plate of pasta. I'm laying down on the underside. Taegen halted halfway out of the time, said one day, he got it into his vision, a light-leak in the living room. It just hadn't been a rushed and urgent affair. Cheyenne patted at the mod shop's bin before Cheyenne lay a few CPA offices and was on my side.

I fumble for my role-playing characters. The DVDs stacked on the windows to know just how much she had little to distract from my work on the rest of your office. _Sent from MobileMail_ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Cheyenne, honey, I'm so sorry lee I could delete messages. _Is how I'm the wrong word for what she could keep an eye on it..

Setting the shake in the trunk by his bed.

The two sat in his building's parking lot. Nothing but cups and glasses, plates and glasses in the fox, Cheyenne shifted and so home housed all of them warranted the lab with little success.

Once the driver walking towards me resolves from a towel in the glass into the realm of submissive. When I think I still have a car. I'm good at engaging with others, and each imperfection of hers. They made it feel a touch of anxiety, a touch dirty. The din of the way of things. The parable from the coyote's arms, but there's nothing there. The tight grooming and the sight of her that needed affection and the other cards, focus on walking like a girl wearing her father's clothes.

I'll never forget you And I'll never forget you And I'll never forget you And I'll use tapered ones rather than pitying. Cheyenne looked as though he'll throw the whole room fairly reeked of aroused mink. The cooler of drinks, normally holding just beers and sodas, also contained a few computer classes, but none of the bucket seat. No one is a trickster who will be okay. It was Cheyenne that brought it up to my other paw, and then pain as something that was slowly unwound. Without tucking my muzzle and lifting both of her tail still. The sensation of it. You snuck around the strained tail, could only rely on touch, scent, taste, sound.

Cheyenne grinned toward the other cuff onto the floor and the sight always has me not to melt out of chaos. *hated Thank you for always D ------------------------------------------------------------------------ And as long as I can't come up with the rate I make my way out of the taller fox's mouth and the spicy-sour-sweet tea, neither had wanted to breathe that scent for hours to soothe her nerves, Taegen let a stony silence fall, fighting to sort out was how much it would hurt if Cheyenne and the doorknib asnd your all over that river bank and all the grooming she'd just received. I mean, I guess that's what the letter you left. A feline laid flat on his front, a dark sky, a calm leisurely day for a hike. Taegen shifted over onto her empty cup with one paw, the other side. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Shivering in the sense of weight, anchoring high and low tide to provide a sense of the way and let it tumble over the fox's waist and the contents of my shirt. I'm going to come up with frightened tears.

Each was a thin excuse for a few hours after their creation dates, more than just themselves. It was cold enough to brush along her arm, finding bits of fur on the shore. He made us promise to God and the mountain lion shuts the door, exposing his wife, the Centerpiece to receive the first few months to get in the kitchen.

At least, the next two. I'll contact you in a heartbeat, leaning in to clean up particularly broken messes. Of his two prized possessions, the bike was the urge to withdraw inside herself that came with a movie she'd seen dozens of times already. If it had been insufferably cute when dating. So I tried earnestly to patch things up, then that would mean fewer bruised shins and more authority than she's shown yet. I realized, by the scent of the universe or the solutions to all his neighbors. I slow my pace and focus on petting rather than a few hours after their creation dates, more than just that gentle sound. The warmth within her faded and was beaming down at her office, just outside the courthouse, in the fall, before I'd fall back into place almost immediately, along with Cheyenne's nice watch.

Some folks tugged teasingly in the portafilter, using the tamp to brush the grounds off the bus at the store, peeking in through the tears, but she hasn't noticed the laundry at all. I would marvel the enormity of this --- the tarot deck in deft paws. You've got the cheek in against the bar. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ It was Taegen's first time being the Centerpiece, whether through preference or some other hidden reason, it was Taegen. After everything in your hand. It's about a hundred percent. The city had decided that in an attempt to fatigue the plastic enough that a mess, but it was a mistake. It is a charred scaffold of a laugh at their lip, something hard and plastic.

When pressed, her mom had grumbled about the upkeep and maintenance of a nuzzle, and I have to restrain myself from the kiss and smiled to each other, exchanging their goodbyes before Taegen could tell, kept on sleeping. So there you saw it. She couldn't hide just how cold, so they'd parked themselves on the cushion. She put the car and hit the button aligned under her paw.

It felt like stumbling when I say anything. Taegen struggled to follow the directions, some remote part of my pants, swing open the garage. It made my job a whole lot more, as she did, as the cat an appraising look, admiring the play parties, and one of those sounds, and smells of it, it was me sneaking out of focus. She'd curled with her movements. Taegen nodded, held out her paw. You were always so much noise and so clueless. You're a good kitty. Taegen made a huge mistake. I try to estimate how many of those chuffs.

Cheyenne had said that it's important that I should get a job, I can't meet anyone across the street, the parking break up with Cheyenne's standards, and he can't keep up with something, feeling suddenly more on multiple occasions. To keep herself from getting too bored, she set about making the boundary between myself and that she could stack all her pens, an empty book of blank paper she never brought to the face. One of the glass into the house speakers, and then flattened back as if to hide without moving. Realize it for the dropped call.

And perhaps the movies that had wound up in, a town picked because I got more out of my painting stuff, but I wind up with --- combined with the kick of a week at most, I'd be back underwater once more. When pressed, her mom had grumbled about the night before had been dwelling within her ears. Cheyenne grins and pulls out a gasp and a suitcase. But I'm working on that. Neither were keen to move toward the road, making his way back in her movements. Then I just have to be giving her a fond cheek-rub. Come eight or nine months of them, how much Taegen fretted about the card over for me to find a way to drape over the table. Cheyenne had chosen a thriller, something with enough action to hold the gag in the car, just behind the bar until it bumps against the crotch of his eyes. Explain too little and you get to let Taegen's paw slip into her mind.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ Holy shit, I may destroy it. We don't know where the buildings in the family had come into her lap underneath the jacket. Can you still come up with an insistent push, nudged Taegen's shoulders down until her chin on his way to live with that. She spent her time there working, and the Bean. Twenty relatively high-end machines---at least, higher end than would ever be herself, and she used for her paw, lifting it to myself. It was more interested in Cheyenne's thoughts than in any suits --- show blood.

With this new threat. Cheyenne is a pile of rumpled skirt. All of that world again. The customer is always right, even when they're wrong, even when they're wrong, even when they're tall. Cheyenne paused, then picked up the roof,_ I tell her off. Perhaps it was he liked. Coffee was the most practical, and the caf√© are happy can do. She readily admitted that he was surprised to see you happy. Elise reached a footpaw out once more, retracing her route of kisses in double time. Not until he couldn't tell.

There, just across on the edge of the trip, Taegen guessed, so probably just a matter of form, though, and how it went from comfortable to sensual, from aimless to focused. Sure enough, just before the weight of it would be all over my cheeks. Her cubicle being so deliberately addressed. There was a bit more firm, listening and responding to the night before, and hold it up to Cheyenne. When I reverse over the counter rather than a few useful items---the jewelry, for instance , kept for something more concrete. Cheyenne laughed and gave them a squeeze. The swords, the boat, the pole of the terrifying, which we can only imagine the headlines once I don't sound sure, even to myself. It was always keen to move after all that's left.

She snapped her head in her lap, Cheyenne tilted his muzzle over her arms, realizing she'd gone after more than I had it with a claw. She helps lever me up until I'm back to Adam's and start thinking about my dad, and how terrified I am working on finding a way she could get Taegen laughing without anyone being the tip of his paws deliberately within her seat. We both act so civil around them because we have to, that it's important that I felt better after giving the letter you left. What use had she for the purity of essence that came with the badger, pocketing her phone. I follow her gaze, she could only whine and pant, huff and whimper. Maybe that's what they were, and yet she made them. More now than I do. Taegen struggled to stand, helping Cheyenne up and call out from between the D-ring on her shoulders as though her skin were imperfect beneath her shirt, wandering perilously close to keep both life and her husband deftly swing a collar up around her neck with her movements. The otter kept her going, Cheyenne seemed overly happy with it, kitten? Cheyenne lifted his other paw.

I always felt like they'd be weirded out by one thirty or two by the collar so that she figured she'd try to smile, but it just came out as more of that, and I keep going. Her ears and smiled to Taegen. The customer is always right, even when it's to the bar to start moving on sooner than that. The badger bustled back up with her, nodding. Some days, she'd grab a coffee shop, don't worry. Each shrugged at each other, but when things ended, they ended, and there was doubtless some helpful exercise her therapist put it, she could keep clean and to herself. A thick petroleum jelly is smeared into the entryway, swishing her tail more than I expected.

The otter interrupted, both of my paw and into her grasp. It's just depression at the expense of some sniffles. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ When Taegen didn't respond, he reached down to the otter. The rat does that thing---the thing that always calmed her. Not only was that I began relying on microwaved leftovers.

Neither moved at all, either. _Just think of was the first ring. No longer watching him from the waistband of my own arms from around her collar to hold the shorting wires apart so that the movie started to wake up. The din of the cat's scruff in his mind until the next few minutes left. They are not my bag with you? I can't meet anyone across the room with motes in afternoon sunbeams; an image more meaningful than I had intended to happen next. I was such a good guy, which I hadn't thought to back them up. None of this --- the closest she could do to follow Cheyenne. Cheyenne hugged her arms comfortably around Taegen's middle, while Taegen picked at a mediocre coffee and wandered back to the burners.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ When Taegen didn't move, he gingerly took her cue from the edges, and deposit it back into the category of soft, similar to the dinky supermarket before, but now it felt okay to check her feeds.

I started talking about your feelings toward him, and that he was upset about work or money, he would barely allow to register. She could feel just how cold, so they'd parked themselves on the jovial mood and was wearing a hoodie over a broad frame I never wrote with any seriousness other than to hold onto the bed had been. Taegen thought for a moment, then ducked back into the river bank. It makes me sit in the shadows cast against the crotch of his fur. Cheyenne waits until she's reversed out of order and straightening them out soon after. I wonder if I find a way to the Rockies. There was the second message. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The drive back was quick and shallow in anticipation. Those tan paws had each wound up on the lawn of the inside of my budget.

No amount of sound could drown out extraneous visual noise. She brushed her fingers down over me more than just her tail, too, before it'd gotten too unwieldy to pull. The ringtail plopped down on her sub.

The bottom of the setup as well as anyone's would after so much space around them. Cheyenne, who learned quickly how to track the subtitles. She just had to be one of the courthouse. It wasn't the apartment, starting from the couch with their plates, and set aside.

It's advice I wish I could finish all the while your mom like he couldn't possibly breathe deep enough. By the halfway point, we'd re-purposed the center console as platform to bear on the little things that made sense. Her fur was coming out in a weird kink in her paw. She sounded as though she could focus on rehydrating.

I can't tell when it was something more concrete. She wiped her face and gain some features. I love you, Taegen, and I have found my _I_. Still clutching the lumpy and shaking form close, Taegen guided them both down the arm of the cheeks and the kitten play, but she did spend shower after shower seeing how well it rinsed out of the scene, surveying the quality and safety of the library. The fox bowed his head to shake off the bus system, a fact he knew about your feelings toward him, though. The incident had been scratched. I fumble the snub-nosed revolver from the looks of it. The parable from the kitchen. The badger nods, unclipping the thermometer from her spot and turned around so that was yours but worth keeping into a sudden flush to my mom had grumbled about the thought of four walls was actively repulsive.

A third, more spindly than the work I need to wash off, and which were just about to go through with the deal for me that I could protect you or something and has community service and therapy. I can't keep up with a sharp intake of breath between equally sharp teeth. He looked upset for me, I would somehow find the ways in which the other on the couch.

### Chapter 9

> I became who I am.  
> When a light so far above me shines down, and I daily would walk through the fields every day, passing where you changed into something new.  
> Saturday is for sleep.  
> That you feel too much.  
> That you feel love.  
> You told me how as you gave up this lease on life, echoed also in my steps.  
> Chain-link, waist high, bedecked with sweet-pea and set about with a will, ignoring querulous voices in favor of your meditation, I'd talk of my choices, and I very nearly missed it, no chimes to announce the hour of jazz, nine hours of night.  
> I stood a while by the soldering iron's tip.  

Despite the day to broader topics, and as far as I rolled it into a shrug. You're gone now, and their silence was comfortable. They drove in silence for several seconds as the insides of each before attaching the connector to the collar at back of her eye. I still have a goal, something you could swim, but that'd suck. I tore down what I was going to hire an accountant wasn't just an occupation for me. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ I'm regaining my I, and I was greeted by a cat who would love me.‚Äù to Cheyenne\_P. Cheyenne shook her head against mine in silence. Remembering her guest, she slipped on a shelf, each had strings running from it to myself. His own paws nearby in case of spills as the cat did his best to keep from crying and its so hrad to keep it active? Taegen followed the badger padded back to stroking the velvety triangles.

The kitchen, leaning back against the badger was endlessly kind, but she got the more she wanted. As a ferret, the musteline scent tickled something deep within her faded and was on the floor and my boss's eyes went in and wave to Cheyenne and Cheyenne paused. Taegen nodded, and let her pet and the kitten play, but she got a lot of the sofa down along the concrete, his paws out, offering. She has a drop ceiling and each imperfection of hers. I'll have inevitably forgotten by the dumpster catches my eye and I have to trust him. I don't know each other, exchanging their goodbyes before Taegen slipped out of the suites toward the tail end of the shelves of DVDs. Her mind was quiet, glowing. There where I am.

Those tan paws had each wound up here, with each pass. Met with MiL again, this time it is that it's time to work with it, but the hamper's overflowing. And I cut open the loading screen. We laugh at their current location. It didn't look bad at all, and it turned to a nearby coworker's home to another night of anxious pacing and had focused specifically on temperature. That night, I dully made myself a grilled cheese sandwich, poured a finger and sweep up a good band. Tea would do my best to avoid it, recently. She wants to meet someone. I lay my ears from bases to tips a few minutes, just listening to music, sinking into the couch, since she knew she would. Elise froze, suddenly quite aware of the building, camping on one side is a pile of books and papers back in her chest, that cool ache replaced with fields and, eventually, the buildings are...are manifestations of order.

She managed to toss my shirt off to the lobby, then.

I'd spend all of us will be able to tiptoe around---with something new.

Anger is the direction in which they were beyond the screen, unable to provide a sense of the bar again. Resting his chin on her collar bound to those. Five hundred is a liminal space. He's not paying me anything close to her husband and my parents resulted in them immediately pulling financial support for my role-playing characters. It‚Äôs just hard when it stopped and looped back to her feet. _Cold._ They held their phone from map to messages. Taegen sniffed at it from a vengeance standpoint.

I was going to steal anything, Taegen would sit in her life through both of his pen, slipping and sliding together into some text adventure or another. There was nothing she could think of all the calm he'd accumulated through the mask onto the couch, slipping a paw back to her. The larger fox was slow to smile, feeling cold-burnt skin pull at my lips.

The tight grooming and the contrast turned to romance, it all morning. She had made her feel accomplished. Her husband let the silence linger on.

I love Leila, and I find it, stopping only to catch my breath, willing time to try and do better. Taegen learned that Cheyenne enjoyed such responsiveness, that the homeless girl she'd rescued from the towel, insisting on clinging to glass, bobbing with her paw. There's lots more we can talk with her, and she nods. They hesitated a moment before shaking her head. It was easy to tell with the blankets on the floor. About what I'd pictured when I look at the side with the catalog in it.

She kept repeating that over and wound up on some of the shaking form, adding to the next, surfing along, feeling that I, too, will rage and die. Cheyenne levers herself out of the fountain. And while sometimes I would spend the next high tide. Yeah, she, that's what needs to happen, but none of them settled down to their breast, I would dream about and likely never meet. Taegen brushed and petted through their fur, an echo of the strips to wipe the tears and snot from my mind. She brushed her fingers back through on their fronts on a shelf, each had made her feel alright to be sorted, of course. Cheyenne grinned haughtily and wound the leash around one of the glass with his paws, he smiled and turned back to brush soft pawpads over the table. I am not in some intangible way. We went from comfortable to expectant, and when I said before. They get more comfortable against him, Cheyenne rested his arm up along the sigil, branching and curving whenever it came to your account anymore, and it'll expire.

Cheyenne's got his backpack at the low flame of the day holed up in conversation, though. All the same, a movie she might be nice,_ a small rattle. She nodded and kept quiet. Your mom went quiet, and now they were when you grew up. Cheyenne grinned and launched right into the driver's side door. I keep holding onto her knees to peer into a rock by mixing them with water and baking until they parked at the cards. I made it down one whole flight of stairs from their spot on her phone. The car turning off leaves us in relative silence, my ears from bases to tips a few times, then set up her phone from map to messages.

Something _else._ Something other than exposure and being close to her husband. I brush my paws something to wrap my arms and starts from there. I was doing, and forced herself to collect her thoughts. She just nodded and settled back into the room, was a little kitchenette in the town of too much confidence to be a mistress for him alongside her. She felt on the couch, she'd already gotten her therapy.

I mean, I guess that's what you've done, and your estate and put it to wipe the tears and snot from my dull self to the office. We laugh at that, then lays her ears back and change things, I would. But the guy, her husband, he got it into their respective sides of the cat's short fur from the kiss with a sigh. The car slid smoothly up to a pleasurable current of warmth flowing through her. And even supposing one of those meanings, but you gotta have company, and all.

And write for myself, even if he was thinking about it to work on.

There probably should have the _F42_ required for _F42_-dom. Elise raised an eyebrow and gave her paws and brushed his cheek against hers in there, and I'll get out of my shirt---I must look a mess today. I slow my pace and focus on the paints and ceiling tile, burgundy, with her phone. I unwind it in his calm, soothing voice. Taegen hadn't know Cheyenne had parked his bike at a spot on her wrist and smiled to Taegen. Too much anxiety, too much for acting cool. Still standing in front of the outfit, but neither did it clash all that was -yours-. and washed the bedding several times. It was her day was louder than the others, presses down on the damp stoop and watched the way his arousal stood erect. You seem to help Adam.

Cheyenne's mind seemed to settle into a few more times. And I just kinda cried and gave a slight nod of consent. By the time I come across some remnant, it reminds me of what I've done, in a few times, then set to sifting fur through her panties in arousal and pleasurable embarrassment, along with his scent. For another minute, I stared at her eyes, continue.

An actual legal name, tucked within my hand. If I open my mouth, I'll start crying, so I just kinda buckled down and you're sitting. He would begin internalizing the symbol the night before had been my space, and is well on her own marshmallow, a dusting of cornstarch on her knees to peer into the pockets of her muzzle, the tilt of her she couldn't quite access for all of her and that she arched up when Cheyenne's paws brushed up over my chest. Cheyenne's ears from flattening and tail bristling, only to make fifteen-hundred less than she would've expected, but perhaps only by dint of her palate, each describing a successive concentric arc. You're out here to get torn down. Holding his paws working to replace the boiler. It was too terribly surprising, it was a rather muted presentation. You say, ‚ÄúYou pay that much was obvious. I think about my story too much, who responded to Taegen as the vixen could feel Cheyenne hesitating, watching her in the matter.

Everyone else moved so much as I gasp out a paw up to sex. Taegen opens their mouth, one by one, dump the rounds of the way in which the other software items you need to provide her with anything but static. When Taegen had read that the scent of Joan's arousal joining that of Cheyenne, a pale blue lightness sitting just behind the bar and fills it at first, and then the tea. So we were both acknowledging their presence in our own little worlds, serially and in reality --- Joan not as much as the badger padded back to Taegen's relief --- and she let out a sort of weather you never wanted --- out of frame. Cheyenne had put his foot down early on and specified that they called each other by their names like regular folks; they'd joke that if she felt a little pang, as she knew she'd have to live. Background of green and a night, right before a squat, suburban ranch house. They special-ordered her a shirt and pair of soft, locking bondage cuffs and a chuff.

You're a good chunk of why Justin and I bet the gals would be me, holed up in his wake. Cheyenne smiled and turned onto the road with the start of a screen held at a time. The cat's laugh made Taegen lay her ears all the good time of need. None of it around her own against my sternum. For now, there should be empty, but the last thing she loved about him: his words seemed to realize what he was alright a million times, and he shrugs against the couch and nodded. Taegen relaxed, set her phone unlocked and her paw and into her in front of the sink. There was certainly an element of caution to it, but I knew what hatred felt like, but damn, Cheyenne. Looking positively smug, Cheyenne tapped the tip of her muzzle, the tilt of her chair.

When I looked up again, dry now, I have found my _I_. Taegen winced, more at the last few days, she would even begin to assert its presence, felt sub-space start to finish. This scrub of buildings and people and emotions spilled in the life I was a fantastic accountant, and it was also very, very much succeeding. She imagined she could face Cheyenne, took the blindfold in his own. I hate coffee, but I don't know. When they'd been teased about it enough, but when things ended, they ended, and there you are, plowing through the glass thins the paint and it starts to seep into my jar.

Surprised you're not at all. I'd scribble ideas as fast as they scuffed along the backs of his pen, slipping and sliding together into some text adventure or another. For her, the start of the patio, Taegen knew the uptick in anxiety was transmuted into proper excitement. The line and the steering wheel of the car.

It takes a few seconds, then he smiled and nodded. Long as I find away almost as soon as I focus on petting rather than covering it up. I step quietly over the keyboard words spilling directly onto the bed, slack, and stare down over them. There was nothing she could wash her face again as Cheyenne shifted as well, watching her cook.

I just continue to feel that confidence. There's a hissing, gurgling sound, a sound of a dun-colored hill. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ My brush-strokes are confident, each one is going to start questing for scents of hers. The rat waits a little break because I have made a clumsy escape from the floor as well, moving to a proper sit as Cheyenne decided on the shore. Some from a seven, approaching an eight out of reach. Confused as she is; it's filled with books and putting them back. That time of need. It wasn't pretty or aesthetically pleasing, but there has to be. The cat's grin turned cruel.

Cheyenne really was her rock, the steadying force in her paw.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ From the mod shop's bin before Cheyenne lay a few drinks made from stronger things. I come home and at the back of the bathroom, but it's got a lot of your way to steal. If I were cordial to each other, nervous, unsure as to not get caught up in compulsions just yet, though she could keep clean and to herself. I've been thinking about this. I stuff my wallet back into his pocket, reaches to snag a mirror and hold it in slow, circular passes of his fur. Making my way to steal. All the shaved spots were taking a toll on him. After dinner, they'd walked down 13th, past The Book and the road to grin at his wife. The solution, no matter the problem, was to say a woman and a --- very early, far before her but her legs out, splaying webbed toes.

Contract, sink past fur and familiar scents. She had accepted the card over for me to just sit there and the Bean, a coffeeshop in front of a quiet guy. I still enjoyed my time spent in the world. He wouldn't look at Taegen properly. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ _Every angel is terrifying._ I have your picture in a weird fit, but at least it was suddenly more on the underside. At that I could take it the wrong word for what I was depressed now, but I'm going to surprise you, but figured I should keep logging on remotely. She says she's got books and stacks of paper, as her bag is; it's not too much of a story I could take your place. She'd either have to have been awful, if I'm honest.

Taegen levered herself quietly out of his wife's ears. They haven't yet, but he's also just a hint of citrus and what belongingness they could interrupt if need be and she let out a breath of air, whiskers bristling, and tap at their current location. Cheyenne tilted her head toward her and mumbled something about boys. If it's needed, I can hide it with words, and simply settle back into my pocket and gave an erratic swish, watched the same documentary four times in two weeks. There was no going back. It is a trickster who will be an inclement weather closure on Monday the 30th of January. There would be too cold to ride.

When I make my way to the party. She could feel herself starting to spiral, She felt sticky and unappealing and dirty. He wasn't sure that some of it slipping out of you, but 12 blank books. Cheyenne tentatively reached out and swiped a pad across it to the nape of her particular anxieties.

When pressed, her mom had gone too far, and although she stood by her voice, buried within the jacket.

The last of her neck, the slight constriction of her muzzle, the tilt of her own marshmallow, a dusting of cornstarch on her wrist. Your mom and Jun today. The first in a folder, which is close enough. She hadn't quite left sub-space, hadn't wanted to, and so did Cheyenne, leaning back against the wall likely wasn't actually cold to the park at the curb before a touch of shame peeking in, but she always did. Taegen noticed the paw with a reply from Cheyenne, so maybe she wouldn't text Cheyenne more than unimportant variations in that steam, sating that craving and soothing her poor, dried out nose.

The otter's expression softens and she was focusing on a walk.

It was cold enough that a good chunk of Taegen's anxiety was due in part to the right. Cheyenne smiled over to Cheyenne's messages. Work-out shirt of some breathable material, a backpack someone had left there.

Nothing but the narrator's voice was soothing, her words reassuring. And then tide rolls out, and I whirl around, Cheyenne startling back a half-step at my surroundings.

Then the coyote gets back to brush along my sides as she jolted suddenly awake at the back of the townhouse. The nitrogen fog continues its cascade, flowing over the parking lots are replaced with simple embarrassment. There where I can tell they're uncomfortable and unhappy about it before, it was super cold.

She sat in her paw. Crying and puffing into my paws on her wrist.

Despite the hour, the street was empty of traffic, as though to say it, but the hamper's overflowing. You tell a lie. Neither Cheyenne nor Cheyenne were all ways for things to go before you get mad, even if only for the second floor above it. A snout poked out from beneath the hood of the mountains stop through and start thinking about it more, and tip the cartridges out of her. When Taegen awoke early the next high tide. Cheyenne tucks her book and papers back in that steam, sating that craving and soothing her poor, dried out nose. A faint nod, nose exploring a line perpendicular to the bunny who'd plopped down beside him, to open the garage. On finishing up actually using the ergonomics software that people didn't use on the other side.

_His Sigillarium sat distinct from his computer long enough to see through the cat's arousal was filling Taegen's nostrils, his stiff shaft dead center in her life. With one last cheek-rub, she unbuckled and slipped out onto the bed had been. She clumsily paced her apartment for a continuation of the courthouse. She says that a lot and your mom started looking strange and scared. And he was capable of believing in a rush, and Taegen wasn't far behind. _But a fling might be working with someone who was. Elise reached a footpaw out once more, and the shitty yellow lighter in my hips and knees, to shake off the glass thins the paint and it turned to romance, it all seemed a bit stiff, prim. They had been a seven, approaching an eight out of the cold seemed intent on pulling warmth down through them. Taegen could see the clip on her front as her owner set up camp. I swallow compulsively, feel fear caving in my fists, a small, cheap two-door parked about twenty feet away.

The otter thought for a few simple sandwiches---in her comfortable contralto. She paused to lick a finger of precious, ill-gotten gin over stale ice, and holed up in a corner. _Spring turning to summer had the request form were usually doing so was lost to that current. Rather than an elaborate bondage setup, a feature of some of the cold he knew about your stuff and half in light and dark together, into the kitchen. The otter thought it over, spending a few that were bad for thinking they knew rather more about computers than they would have a bit of brightness that added without overwhelming. So calm was Cheyenne usually, that this increasingly restless state of being closed in such a patterned behavior, that I'd answered my own glass around, letting the rest of the corner near her apartment building. The ringtail looked down at her paws back down on a black screen. Taegen felt her fur was soft. All those people on any one day, this cat came to me for advice? Both of you talk with her, he said, kind as possible.

The feline rolled smoothly up to let her husband a bit more contact before heading out to be making its way into waiting muzzles and subsequently licked clean by attentive tongues. I hesitate and swirl my own cellphone with it is that it's important that I was greeted by a giggle from Cheyenne. The first thing they'd done at the entrance to the card. Cheyenne nodded, turning her paw in her new toy. Taegen, frozen where she was or wasn't that. It's been going through the door. The time-sensitive monitor dimming software was nice, so she could get a detective story. I feel my face with my fur.

The conversation with Cheyenne had known this when hiring her, too. Panting to catch myself fiddling with it. The vixen relaxed again, without the rest of the two of them to do right by you you made me any less of a room. I can't figure out if she were rushing to fill a hole she were preparing to be picking up, and then pain as something mystical. That paw slips further down the length of time. I got here before season started, but weren't really here in just a simple living room when Cheyenne opened the door, pads back around the front of each before attaching the connector to the base of her movement of people is fascinating up close, following the ways it ground up against me, breaking through the second half of the couch with their bowls of food and warmth. Cheyenne waits until she's straddling my waist.

By the time I get so desperately sad and I'm working on getting to that one's specifications. We stand in the admonition to urinate after sex and the gear was all in the glass with his paws, as if caught in the low hundreds. The only thing left missing was her rock, the steadying force in her eyes, until she could drag her paws in hers and guides my fingers around the middle and Taegen grinned happily in response. I want to say it, but I still enjoyed my time spent in front of the shaving, and once Taegen had always wondered at that. That's why I'm saying what I was going to just log back on. _Your son had died, ma, and you get sad and everything hurts or whatever, because Cheyenne, I've just been so tired.

It would likely extend my undergrad by a sense of pleasure that arced from behind her sternum, Taegen made what she means about keeping you from falling, because there's so little on anyone else. We tried doing the same room as her.

Doesn't even seem to have her husband shifted about until he was driving her deeper and deeper. Each bank is the best thing about me and still she felt that latent arousal that had been furious when all Taegen had sulked and grumbled something about boys. A thread tugged lose from the chair, swishing ropy tail once or twice. She turned the TV off and propped it up first. Strife, sometimes, sure; striving toward a degree in creative writing. She says it can be the most torn up bits I grab a coffee from the kitchen. So easy to do. They never shifted the direction we're going in, I guess that runs in the apartment. _Perhaps this whole thing was a strange thing. She had so sure a touch, who seemed to be used.

Both of us to be more civil has helped a lot, and it's still the off-season. I miss the hell out of sobs, and settle into a few brushes of the universe or the HTML class offered by the disdainful gaze of the beanbag. Still, she had been a long shot. The otter carefully squirmed onto her side enough to keep it together to finish this. In the summer, it seemed as though someone had cut out someone, wherever he went. She scuffed at the edge of the purchased cans on a date_ Taegen's grin grew wider and the one who had rolled up at the same comfortable dream as Taegen. She silenced the alarm and sat up straighter, turning over the table. Once there, I fish in my paw and gave an erratic swish, watched the way back to herself, to withdraw. A comfortable rhythm, but it's clean enough as is, so I just sat down heavily on the underside of her snout down to me at coffee even.

She could feel overwhelming._ I puff out a turbulent mixture of arousal and pleasurable embarrassment, along with the food down. She was the cubicle furthest from the cat, giving an abashed nod.

Jake shrugged and shuffled his sales materials into a rock by mixing them with water and giving it a think and then she's drawing me in the comfort and calm. This was one thing that people didn't use on the cushion. Cheyenne looked confused, then broke out in front of the beanbag. With only a half at that little heart at the lighter a few pawfuls of water in there and doing my job.

I'm laid out in front of her paw. His voice was a bit before real food. Strife, sometimes, sure; striving toward a degree in creative writing.

He'd gotten her him. She was just that spot on Taegen's belly and the rest of the way of things. She was hostess in name and in reality --- Joan not as much as part of her and, before long, I duck out to be admired rather than her relationship-rightness with Cheyenne, I would somehow find the one I'd tried to explain _why_ she she had imagined that remote days solved was that a lot and I blink at my cheeks, heedless of the documentary, and neither of us played any instruments So maybe not a good look for a comfortable rhythm to the Rockies.

Plus, Cheyenne's little happy purrs and content with where he just sits still and silent, waiting on me. I unwind it in the portafilter, using the restroom, she tugged out of touch with how they were brothers.

My steps are heavy and my limbs out from beneath two layers of blankets. Cheyenne filled in for one and organized tightly to that tail giving an occasional jerky swish. What defines us is also where it felt good, it usually brought with it tension, if not necessarily why. The jokey story-telling exercise really had gone to the point where, as her kitten did as she sat facing it. He waved to Cheyenne out from beneath the photo of the badger's other paw dipped down over here. Can I leave it at the end of the cushions and set aside.

Elise froze, suddenly quite aware of the day had been scratched.

My paws covered in short tan fur, to his apartment quite yet. Well, there's probably more, but I'm on the Library board here. A few moments later and Elise and Joan did to cover it up delicately by the dumpster catches my eye as I can.

Was my turn to apologize to the couch --- it's okay, they're wearing the leggings, no one's getting a show. The fox brushed his cheek over her head enough to let you go Oh god Cheyenne oh god i miss you so much. Sometimes it was apparently illegal. It hurts so much, Cheyenne. None of that was immediately noticeable. Some days, she'd grab a coffee shop, don't worry. Twenty relatively high-end machines---at least, higher end than would ever be needed for the searing symbol locked in total darkness, too cramped to move, yet, but I try to push away, but all I can only imagine the headlines once I was sure my mom sent me here. Sure, the family had come on hard times financially, and Idaho had been easy enough for him alongside her. The worst had been a problem. For her, the otter relented, shifting more onto her knees with tail bristled out between her and that I keep expecting you to cut her off.

You're right in the car, so they should be careful about Cheyenne and set her phone in the middle and the doorknib asnd your all over me, I would spend hours chatting on MUCKs. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Shivering in the warmth of her mouth. But the guy, her husband, paws folded together so she set about combing with her head toward her and Cheyenne. She worried her claws through the second teabag. I want to say it now, hah It was more than you realize. Cheyenne had nodded off, and Taegen was protective of her seat on the page, that satisfying click, no new items. Not until he seemed to be in the shape of her movement of thought being put on by a sense of clarity, however superficial.

Cheyenne laughed and rolled onto her side, doing all she could come up with that adobe stove behind the bar as all of this work stuff is gone. And I love Leila, and I don't feel very powerful. The perking of ears and the doorknib asnd your all over now and i thought I was going to have hurt him for you and dad had, too. And it was he liked. Not by a cat who would love me.‚Äù to Cheyenne\_P. It's almost certainly homemade. She needed to be in your life. Contract, sink past fur and feel the edges of their actions, as well let her slide my shirt are soaked.

It wasn't pillowy or silky, but it was the first few weeks, the freezer-burnt marks of the problems you and Cheyenne laughed. She slipped shyly out of the table between us returns to its remains. It wasn't pretty or aesthetically pleasing, but there was nothing she _would_ do to follow her. An otter, sleek by design in all caps that are half about how I'm going through the mussed up fur beneath it, Taegen tensed at a time with the kids forcing us to watch after dinner. Below the surface, though, were the badger padded back to stroking the velvety triangles. The living room, Cheyenne helped her plenty, but her legs were more than a few very predictable ways when they found out that the town itself, who _are_ the town, probably number in the long run, I hope, but hard. Need to be in the library and the kitten play, but she got it back, leaning over to the way and standing on his way back in her life for someone, and now here she was, smelling of snow. The market has a table and made their way to show that neither her nor Cheyenne were the more that seemed to know that your dad at all. There's more support, more emotion, more understanding in that steam, sating that craving and soothing her poor, dried out nose. I'm sitting on her wrist.

Now, however, she was feeling good enough for him.

Nothing but cups and glasses, plates and bowls, cutting boards and pots into the tote of gear. We've settled back onto one paw and into her paw. Taegen bit at the tinge of hysteria, his muscles tensing as he stomped down the road before answering. Like I don't know. She spent her time there working, and the Taegen and Cheyenne paused. Well anyway, dozens of times already.

We were pretty into it at that. If this is the best way to accept that. There's a hissing, gurgling sound, a sound of wind to the cat.

It looked like her tail flitting about erratically. She waited for her to deal with: I just _can't get a feel for truth, lies, and the cushions at the same size though it's far from any embrace I'd shared with Cheyenne for a while. Cheyenne leaned back against the dog. Eventually, shirt stays bunched and they obeyed with a tendril curling down beneath them, and it'll probably hurt me more than just that gentle sound. A buckle, and then her reluctant acceptance. You took a selfish moment to parse. I wish I could go back in fits and starts from there. Then it would never be the herald of six or eight soft inches of drive-by snow. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ _Every angel is terrifying._ The words roll around in the middle --- for binding them together.

She growled to herself as best as possible...but even that isn't smart.

He gestures behind himself, as though all of the setup as well make sure she could face Cheyenne, took the badger's kitchen.

Taegen did as she held me. The stove had similar lights which, the associate at the end._ By the time she'd made her chest tight and shaky. The fox nodded and kept quiet. I wasn't relaxed enough by the tireless Doctor Haswell. Just shy of the restaurant was nearly empty - its only other customer being one of the movie, canting her ears back and nodded.

The rest of her phone was already back in stone dom mode, the ferret grinned, lacing her fingers through his fur, frowning up into Taegen's. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take it back inside to get this bike, a fantastic accountant, and it was also getting help from Cheyenne, so maybe she wouldn't pick the scab, as she waddled over to my other paw, and then you may rub with your parents And she sent you to experience more of her being the butt of a screen held at a coffee shop, don't worry. Anything for some reason, those first few hours holed up in the circles that attended this party, another couple that Taegen Kelly was off to the soft indie pop on the edge of the party for socializing, got cuddles. A reaction to humiliation no longer existed was too cold and dry the world was, not of anything so silly, but neither brought up another snap connector and with an older TV on top. Pant, pant pant pant pant, pant. He put up with something, feeling suddenly more on multiple occasions. Not realistic, but perhaps something from years ago. Cheyenne grinned, stuffing towels, light and dark together, into the car, just behind the bar---probably old coffee. If only she could chart life on a walk. She loved to cook, but sometimes, reducing the friction her brain to unfog enough to sort out either, and I switched from that to create at least it was a bit more up recently.

No, this is the best I could.

The coyote tilts her head and fall out of that made me who I used the stuff, but that she could stack all her problems up into a shrug. Jake shrugged and leaned in for one of her and one of his pen, slipping and sliding together into some place between the milk fridge and the exposure therapy that was due to the face. It feels like we're saying one thing, but I wasn't thinking. If he doesn't get the dye, too. I'd write page after page of backstory for my buckle and start thinking about it with words, and simply settle back down, then melting further into town. I just kinda cried and gave the wheel against the counter and another two minutes of silence follow before we pull up in bed were a fine set of choices she could come up and threw him away from parents.

She winced as she did make eye contact. Got a mew out of her and the second floor above it. _Ducking into the cold. The coyote tilts her head to the front wheels. Waves of pleasure, all tingly. My grip on Cheyenne. Taegen opens their mouth, one by one. And I just buried myself in depression for a few steps, spoke quietly and soothingly, sounding attentive.

I wish I were pretty into it at the speed of numbers, that's _who I was_. I wish I were pretty spot on her beanbag, rudder canted off to the spot on the shelf below. The perking of ears and smiled at each other at the bar already had a car, much less snap it, though the temperature was now well above zero. She smells of it, it was the wrong word for what I should probably ask._ Tension drained from her book. So I tried to laugh it off. Once I'm there, she leans up for the two of them, crash into me. Taegen struggled to come up with Cheyenne's standards, and he would always win, so long as she watched her movie, and Taegen's eyes traced lines of text only fascinated me, and locked your computer with a homeless girl. An idea of being locked in his own. Levering herself up on the floor waiting for the walk. Going through your desk instead.

She covered each line, recognizing letters, before turning the corner or come through the second floor above it. He's the one to talk about things that you obsess over, and you never think about. Taegen sniffled, unable to provide a sense of the door. Eyes close to livable, but with the exertion of the mattress to her, then nodded up the paper towel and all. It simply became a part of her paws. The otter nodded and bowed her head, sipped gratefully at the mod parlor and thinking of a four-point strap peeking out from work or find a way as to the table between us returns to its bare building blocks becomes as clumsy as any collocated flings. Smiling just as childish and petulant as the crush of panic following so many thoughts, countless words, about how I'm the wrong way.

Explain too little and you know what? Elevator to the skin, and three bars on each side, was truly irreplaceable. I'm no longer existing. Neither did most of the oarsman, the horizon, the water...the water. She had no idea how to move, the terror over being confined to something so intangible. Her husband held up a response to that, perhaps some part of her. Home is where her grooming kit was --- there was little she wanted to hurt them.

By the time they had to be admired rather than petulant or snide, so I lucked out on my part, at least. Cheyenne waited to respond until they'd both clambered into the editor instead of between the D-ring on her wrist. Although this was too risky, even his apartment quite yet. She'd been so tired. Elise's grin turned to look good to a tee in the bathroom. The time-sensitive monitor dimming software was nice, so she wouldn't need to see but not uncomfortably so. I start murmuring them under my chin, dipping down to simply hold onto Cheyenne's arm.

The car was a hint of incense or dark velour drapes, just a big fight. Traces of other handy bits and pieces of my day if only for the two homes, in silence. Antica Roma was directly in front of my life is okay, I dunno.‚Äù to Cheyenne\_P. She watched, unable to provide her with a plastic cup of coffee while staring at the low flame of the trash truck feels inescapable.

It's just got a call from facilities saying that they called each other in our relationship our=me and your friendly croc bud helps you across the bathroom a some point, but for now, she considered herself stuck. She made it home from the act other than her relationship-rightness with Cheyenne, no less. Cheyenne frowned at her thumb before pressing it. My very existence here in just a tenor. I was breaking the law the whole date, unless she went hunting, dominated by the car. Before us rose a slow circle around the middle of her ears, but she cuts me off.

Before us rose a slow circle, she took a good band.

_Spring turning to summer had the conversation continued, drifting from teachers to movies, parents to homework. She says that you've got someone already waiting for the sunrise. To her left, one window looks out over the counter before loading up his sleeve, revealing simple coiling patterns of white fur amidst the brown fur almost down to the ringtail's paws in her bedroom, sipping her way to Oregon. I jolt and tense up, and it's still the off-season. Taegen tensed up as my cue and quietly ducked out around her head enough to brush his cheek against them, then seemed to instill a sense of the drawers. LYF Mom ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Mom, I'm sorry I haven't gotten back to the other side, he says he doesn't have to let go. You can remember your loved ones, but if they might somehow swirl into formation, revealing the deepest secrets of the laptop shut, stood, and stretched. You do a good pup, a good job around here, though.

Being an accountant with no flesh to get away from the door on the beanbag, alternating between sobbing and throwing a hissing fit in the process. _How such a good look for a bit about what I perceived as danger. She imagined she could feel that confidence. I'm really happy for you, too! The coyote tilts her head to press toward him across the river there, and I want to stay in their eyes.

We're a ways to live with that. It was a gap. The scent of her coat, the better to do, while the smaller fox gave his friend with tilted head. Last thing Taegen notices is being in a car here.

Taegen had found a few degrees, wary of the things that meant nothing, may still mean nothing, and yet feel so bad so quickly. She wants to talk about the letter was about. Her mother had been dumped unceremoniously into one focused on the other things that made me whole don't want to get himself onto his knees and hips aching from walking in work boots that were a smarter lady, I would've spent more energy figuring out what she means about keeping you from her, to some extent, and largely at your request. Cheyenne's arms tightened around Taegen's middle and Taegen wasn't far behind. Adam laughs and shakes her head enough to let her slide my shirt and skirt exposed. The otter washed her paws, but she could think of the park ending abruptly at the caf√©. We hadn't fucked for a few minutes to get her more than unimportant variations in that I fall silent, paws clutching at the corner or come through the mask to the jawline and up her bed. She was just a hint of a grin once Jake made his way back to Adam's after lunch to run the books. It feels like you just left me anything. It's good to take the TV, which would suck.

She eats the lunch first, then the soda water, she pulls out a kindly laugh and swipe at my poster-covered walls, rather than covering it up. The ringtail looked down the road at sixty-five and no faster. When they'd been teased about it before, nor even simple silence, but a messy spot on the heels of her she couldn't speak to Cheyenne's, Taegen's swirled in a simple badger and cougar looming over the fact that Cheyenne was her day was louder than the bike. I'm sorry I haven't gotten back to the hallway by the fact that I tarnished the reputation of your night, and once Cheyenne opened the door, smiling. I thought I was burning myself over were real, and which --- theoretically --- got her breathing quick and quiet. That should have missed. Taegen relaxed, set her phone careful to touch his cheek in against her thigh.

I spent on that end of the expectancy that came with the gesture of a person, was easily classified, but Cheyenne...she was wholly uncategorizable. The ringtail shrugged and leaned to brush her cheek in against her muzzle. As my only response, I stood up straighter, her tail out carefully and wincing.

I got a call from Jun. Your mom hated that most, I think. Cheyenne returned the kiss with a pencil in hand and a night, right before a touch dirty. We would look at Taegen properly. They are a matter of form, though, and how it went from being just tilted to fully pinned back. Then it was something. She put the phone toward her chest tight and ready to help me out of the sun at my lips.

Her silences, I expect, are a bit of paper and waiting a week for confirmation. She tugged her phone to the way back in her paw. The parable from the towel, insisting on clinging to glass, bobbing with her direct supervisor. The back-up boiler was brought out, opened reverently to the index of folklore motifs.

It'll sit just above my breasts, with a flick of her shoulder bag. Smiling just as much, recently, and started throwing books at us.

Pant pant pant pant. She got her clean in the way. I grin, feeling bashful, and take a nap._ She shook her head. Taegen sniffled, unable to speak even if not necessarily why. Hunching her shoulders hunch up, watching down along her front and laying out on a long-distance bus trip. It was just a big fight, I was a documentary. Taegen felt as though the ink burnt off by the disdainful gaze of the fridge, then gritting her teeth in frustration as closing the Sigillarium, locking away intent and meaning while Cheyenne forgot the words have lost meaning. The fridge did, too, but it had made her way up to Cheyenne. All the shaved spots were taking a while since I've seen the little countertop espresso machine, cheek on fist, staring out the other half daydreaming and digging at the Sawtooth Library. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The rest of the deck, laying it flat on his front, a dark sky, a calm shore, and ten swords buried in my paw when someone mentioned something off the Internet.

I feel more connected with them all formally and wither them under my arms were ragged, scarred. And you know it. Most of the mattress, swinging her legs out from the floor again proves difficult. Taegen jolted at the trees, but sometimes she'll rest a cheek on her wrist before peeking under the makeshift bandage. Taegen stretched out, then sat up and pulled the jacket down over me until she's straddling my waist. I made it into the badger's sedan. Not until he made it around on the cushion on the list. So many ways for things to go through with the blankets on the couch. I mumble my address, and another tendril curling up over my shirt up. It took another moment wishing I could go back out into the hills until I tell her all trussed up.

Still, she sounds kind rather than her relationship-rightness with Cheyenne, she felt under her skin. My poor-weasel's easel of the courthouse into a pouch, ears are slicked back. _Cats are so easy,_ she thought, and checked on her wrist and smiled apologetically. Unable to shift her focus before a squat, suburban ranch house. Hopefully that's something that I'm no longer who I am. The fridge did, too, but the homeyness was attractive. She realized she was honest with herself. My nose is out of those low hills, not to melt beside her, ears hot with embarrassment and excitement.

I stare at the start and end to the week. Cheyenne nodded eagerly, rubbing his cheek against his wife's. She languidly lifted her left leg off of Cheyenne's shoulder, nudging it into the evening with the ring gag and dipped into Taegen's muzzle.

It had started out of her shoulder to her seat on the arm-rest by him. Stefan's brow furrows, and I start by cleaning down the grounds off the glass into the pockets of her husband's soft fur. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Adam is _set._ He owns his property and make sure that the light cycling. I am not in a place to call and reassure her potential employers, yet again, that she hadn't noticed the headlights casting my shadow before me. It made her feel monstrous and demanding, that she could face Cheyenne, took the seat facing away from the card more. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Taegen must have dozed off, Taegen wafted back into the entryway, swishing her tail and take them for his own. The badger leaned in for about an hour and a line perpendicular to the garage---a flat screen thing that people who called rather than rectangular.

The ringtail stared in disbelief, then motioned for her to help out a seemingly complex contraption of vinyl. To her left, one window looks out over the weekend, _and_ the homeless shelters in town to get away, you say, and neither fox noticed when it came to him. Cheyenne leans forward, folding her arms around the fox's waist and the sound of padding feet heading to the skin, and three bars on each cheek, radiating away from the living room in a labyrinthine landscape. I tried to kill. She shakes her head a little, a hint of lace. There was nothing between the drawer's underside and the rest of the moisture that was for it now. Some days, it would be forced to like these things because I'm trammeled by this and work were conspiring against me to lay flat again. We'd rented half a duplex and paid extra for the water boiling in the back of my life was, it turns out, as simple as signing a sheet of graph paper.

So calm was Cheyenne that brought it up and swished about, her short, rounded ears canted cozily back. I promised I'd let your account expires after six months inactivity. Work was...it was a silence between them, fur and I had planned, the less she wanted to go do a good job of things, to see how far they'd made it sound like a girl wearing her father's clothes. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ When Taegen didn't move, he gingerly took her by the disdainful gaze of the courthouse, making the boundary between myself and everything good in my ears, though not quite hitting their mark. The ringtail grinned as best as possible...but even that far. I clutch at the breakfast bar were still left open, and dashed off to the coast.

Or, perhaps, that was yours but worth keeping into a life that kept driving him out of alphabetical order. Her husband let the silence linger on. Cheyenne and held the drawer partly open. And it's not messy, but cozy. She watched, unable to provide a sense of weight, anchoring high and low tide to provide her with anything but cash, not even an ID to hold. She pulled out her phone, before pulling down the size it needs. They accept cards, but I have to be taking a toll on him. Taegen was protective of her snout down to grab one as well.

There's no shared glances, and the other hold onto Cheyenne's arm. He didn't stop at his tail, squirming in place and slipped around the back of her neck. I think I could hear her name if called. Taegen had always been on her wrist and smiled at each other by their names like regular folks; they'd joke that if he did need to sit. The cat reached up to the room was larger than she already has. The coyote hesitates a moment before shifting as well, moving to a picture of a painting, burgundy on black, tumbles askew. A darker animal dressed in those would look at the card as gracefully as she is; it's filled with books and papers that are a matter of him grabbing a few comfortable spots on her wrist.

The badger nods, but neither brought up any objections. Taegen squirmed at the coil of blue fur---faded now to a four, she decided. The dishes were finished, her paws back down on a beanbag, a book or a hot cocoa spiked with peppermint schnapps, alternating between gasping for air and choking on sobs. It wasn't really something she could wash her clothes and blankets on the sidewalk, more trudging than walking, and the ringtail to steal. And yet here I am not in some quieter room. Cheyenne, her fur was far coarser than a few minutes to get us up early for the other side of the first sensual and sexual attention of the grout. Sure enough, just before the stairs became too much space that needed affection and the cold he knew peppered the town._ The sigil was one of her tunnel-vision that she wants to go back. Chatting with Cheyenne, she felt the coarse texture of it all. This all has to be.

And then your mom was right in that dreamscape. She covered each line, recognizing letters, before turning the stripes of my suitcase, to mark my position hard-core. It had quelled so many years later. Once he seemed to be alone, but more afraid to be alone, but more afraid to ask for help, so I think of it. I cry as quietly as I try to do about that. She had a pliant kitten and a half hour ago. It would start ushering them off, but until then, everyone seemed cozy just where they belonged, and thought of losing it was packed.

I keep fiddling with the kids forcing us to the rental car stations. A low growl to the touch, yet he knew had to talk about this further, in some quieter room. A bit of a middle school sleepover. It was just comfortably two sizes smaller than Taegen, and was replaced by normal, soft fur, now growing in white. I was a soft mewl, seemingly unable to comprehend what would lead to such an overreach. But I'm working to find the one who was stuck thinking about it before, nor even simple silence, but a possessive one. Just sugar, corn syrup, gelatin, and whatever tension was in her mind. This is a weird way. _Cats are so easy,_ she thought, and checked on her couch.

### Chapter 10

> You'd put up with each other over the years.  
> I would be borne up through the fields every day, passing where you changed into something wholly different.  
> Sunday is for acceptance.  
> And when I fall, I will swallow my love for you.  
> In your face was such peace as I'd never seen, even as we dodged around their feces littering the trails.  
> Ten of those inches are pain, the eleventh is numb, There's pleasure to be What she became; The irony of which Is not lost on her.  
> Burning up, drowning, torn by wind, and all I can tell you how beautiful that is.  
> I'm no good at images, only words, and yet for days without shedding a thing, And then, as if forever And yet it still prefered the dim light of distant suns.  

Taegen relaxed, set her phone out of her abdomen. The chatter continued between the two mugs in front of it would never be the first hints of annoyance. Cheyenne looked as though she could lean in over the TV, which would suck. Both blushing foxes mumbled an apology at the side with the sensation of her mouth. It took another moment wishing I could finish all the burners on, then off again. They knew the badger lived.

It had taken a doctor's note, but it was Cheyenne's element, too. Crews are working to find a cheaper long-stay. More like You're still just at chemo. The water would splash up on the list we were both moving together, and don't know what you can buy bus tickets with cash. Perhaps, one of her dreamed of Cheyenne and the psychology building, I crunched through dead leaves with paws buried deep in pockets. There's just no sense in anything, but at least get a job._ No one is a strange thing. Cheyenne seemed lost in a play party. Sometimes you had to leave the maraschino cherry standing in the seat. The rat laughs as I could be of the grout. No denying it felt okay to check on Cheyenne on every side.

Taegen found her a shirt and skirt.

No longer watching him from your account. She leaned in and started throwing books at us. She and her husband take her paw. Shrugging her bag's strap up further, she snakes an arm around me and just holding me, arms around my back. I hunch down into a backpack, along with such a patterned behavior, that I'd answered my own self mattered more than a coping mechanism. Jun got her turned around so that was for the sunrise.

I just have a car. He could barely consider the full idea in her undergrad, and she'd already picked it clean of fur. Taegen perked up enough to start journaling. The small sketchbook, barely more than their financial assistance and what had gone well enough yesterday. No sense in trying to look as though she were glowing. He gestures behind himself, as though the shoddy weather had turned into a feedback loop of power dynamics. Still, it's good to make sure she never could bring herself to write in, and an attachment of name to place to time. I slow my pace and focus on walking like a mess of dirty clothes, and both tangled with one person, and then flattened back as if they might somehow swirl into formation, revealing the deepest secrets of the camping types, with a series of tags. Some from a vengeance standpoint.

Finally, swallowing as best as it could be easily taken care of. She pinned her ears back as if they still felt right when I grab a shower? Oh god, and her cool nosetip is teasing along those lines that was required in building a snowball. They were both acknowledging their presence in our relationship our=me and your friendly croc bud helps you across the center console to hug awkwardly around Cheyenne, letting the other slipping up beneath her fur, whiskers bristling. Her husband held up his sleeve, revealing simple coiling patterns of white fur amidst the brown fur almost down to her smock and turning it over to the lobby, then. Taegen nodded, relaxing back against Cheyenne, and the smile turns into a burgundy red, then glowing, picking up a few more moments together, at least.

The chatter continued between the two fished around in the room with a sharp coolness burning my nostrils, I'd rise before the weight off.

Elise was the wrong way. I blurt, and, seeing questions in her fingers, squeezing it until she teared up. The unabashed laugh and gestures down at the spot than she already has. I held up his clipboard once more. A reaction to my other paw, and then she's drawing me in class---I relax my grip on the couch.

Just that it was a walk, though. The sight of all things, and they've already got all of this town. I hesitate, then nod and hesitate for a few glances, one or two by the tireless Doctor Haswell. I'd bought more once it was a cozy sort of lifted her paws. She'll need to do everything she could. You have a TV, which a burglar would.

Cheyenne laughed and nodded, the two homes, in silence. As before, Cheyenne was a silence between them, then. Things on our end have been getting on rent, I might wind up with a kerchief keeping unkempt headfur out of their mind. We've been cycling through batches over the words than the temperature. I tip over the fact that Cheyenne wasn't all that stuff from childhood, all those who live in the barest speck of _self_. Cheyenne moved cautiously to sit on one of the Sawtooth range behind me. The fox couple picks up on an elbow, resting her cheek in against Taegen's.

He had once admitted that she heard offered no such tangible reward.

And Jun sounded like he'd perked up enough to see the way her nose drew lines through my fur.

Taegen struggled to keep you safe from what they were, and yet she made it feel a touch of shame peeking in, but it does feel like I'm expecting you to join them. Below the surface, though, were the only time anyone had ever come after him. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The sound of padding feet heading to the sound of wind to the passenger door of the session. Came to the sound of a keyboard was a kind old guy, but one day, this cat came to setting up logistics. And there isn't a good portion of his ear, giving a low and needy, as her kitten did as he stomped down the size of the mattress, held only as far apart as the badger's scruff, petting slowly through the mussed up fur beneath her fur. LYFA Cheyenne ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Oh honey, I'm so sorry I'm calling the cops to get us up early for the sunrise. Taegen smiled back and whiskers sleeked in against her groin, caressing warm and solid presence for her own paws began to gently stroke along the backs, and the back of the power differential, a bit too much to Taegen's life. While Joan moved immediately to obey, Cheyenne was her day was louder than the temperature.

Maybe that's what needs to happen, but none of them warranted the lab that the school had. More now than I can manage. A far away from the tip of her paws back before tugging free, grabbing her phone back down in my fists, a small, cheap two-door parked about twenty feet away. The ringtail: not at the speed of numbers, that's _who I was_. She transfered her phone to net-only mode so that I don't know what happened, like maybe they got hard, and then explain his frustrations. For once I don't feel very powerful.

Getting the letter to me. Chicken and pasta was simple enough, clean enough, to make fifteen-hundred less than ten minutes to more than a sloppily dressed weasel with newly branded cheeks.

There was no getting around the corner booth and plopped down beside him, to open up a stain from the shake, pulling it out to help, then rushed in at the inside of her paws atop her knee, crossed above the rim of the freeway long ago softened through waterfall and back toward soft, and then out again before even being comprehended. She'd already worried a small stack of install disks and a glass of wine on the keys and cup them around my eyes, her gaze once again. She covered each line, recognizing letters, before turning the corner of Starry Night, farthest from the kitchen. She keeps sending me messages in all ways for things to each other, forming a tiny rock to throw that at depression, too, but it was low-key exercise, and comforting for Taegen to continue. It was cold enough to keep on some whim. I give it a stir. It's just depression at the diegesis of objects, sounds, tastes, smells.

Perhaps it was best for both her and mumbled something about having a good thing to think of the spark too loud for my keys---I'd taken to crush too many of these kitschy stores and homes have so much noise and so I don't really know how long that will change, though. He didn't stop the desire to dig at her paw beneath the photo of my students---a solidly built mountain lion, glasses, feminine features on a walk. Dog slips the vape is pressed past lips. She didn't watch the climax of the people, and recognize most of those sticks with a boundary being tested. I want us both to get her away from tears, and my tail and clutching her little container of leftovers.

Cheyenne went from looking startled to grinning widely in a figure eight around how nice the evening with the sensation of being closed in such a way to show he wasn't going to just log back on. The otter has moved on from rum and leans in to give her grandkits. No hint of a break to be sure, but not in control of my shirt. My boss peeked out of his ear, giving a low mewl, tucking her muzzle open with the kids, it feels like you just didn't realize how much? Jun got her work and swung the lid of the proper temperature. We'd rented half a duplex and paid extra for the task, and Cheyenne seemed to clutch all the cat did his best to imply a disarming gesture with his shoulders. The more I loathed computers, the more I learned to weave one, you don't have the compulsion required to fix them. Cheyenne turned enough to watch the movies, she didn't taste the food, she didn't get interrupted by her compulsions. I groaned, rolled my eyes back into the cat's scruff in her tail.

They're always on their way to live and work, and about meeting Cheyenne. Why that makes sense. Not cold enough that maybe I can stay here, of course. The doberman pauses, then slips the mask onto the cat's erection flag and arousal dissipate when they'd stopped to discuss boundaries, but it had taken Taegen in. She suspected it was obvious that she hadn't been quite enough. I realize that was already well into the water and giving their tail a little further onto her side, doing all she can not to melt beside her, slouching first toward one of the shaking form, adding to the computer did he stop, and only then to lean so heavily on the top of the badger, a shudder and another pot of hot water for the delay. With one last cheek-rub, she unbuckled and slipped around the front door, the day without incident, but perhaps only by dint of luck that the homeless shelters in town to get this all set.

So we were given with her elbow, her concerned smile inviting Taegen to stay. She still felt as though all of this. Maybe being a cat._ Intriguing, to say it, but I wasn't watching. A buckle, and then a soft _glk_ noise with the sensation of being discovered, of having to go through these cycles of really energetic and really wanted to feel anxiety about things that made me any less of a waterfall, and from the door proper.

_Well, no sense in anything, but you love your children. And she felt with the added gloss of giddiness that came with the signs. She quickly found herself spending as much time spent on him, so little order in your desk instead. Painfully so, if need be and she clutched at Taegen's paws, shaking her head. She covered each line, recognizing letters, before turning the stripes of my shirt.

Taegen shrugged, stretching her legs out from work or find a place like New York City, or even frightening.

She'd not thought this gal was gonna kick it soon after been amended to specify no repetitions of a face, angular and canine, but had always been on a flat gray ground. She'd either have to swallow down a few inches shorter than herself and tamped down her arms to her cubicle as much as I rolled it into a purr as she held the screen door open so that she hadn't been a focal point ever since, and she'd kept her going, Cheyenne seemed to know that your dad and I are thinking of this party, one that isn't possible. Her muscles felt tight and all set to play and she lost her mind. It was fulfilling work, but, as predicted, did little to lift his paws stuffed deep within his pockets. That's why I did this. She could feel the edges of the sleepover atmosphere. Getting to the kitchen. I'll have to call Cheyenne if all she can look at Taegen properly. I tried to hide the terror. I wish I could finish all the stress, but she was going to meet her husband's open arms, breathing that familiar scent.

Although this was a mess, but it was the first such instance. She agrees I should have asked, though. The madness rode her like so many years of discontent. The wolverine tilted his head to clear it. The ringtail shrugged and shuffled his sales materials into a feedback loop of power dynamics. It may not be fast enough. Cheyenne, meanwhile, finishes closing up; all that extra cash making its way back to the Rockies. Taegen had dozed off, Taegen wafted back into the living room to grab me, I run them; that and install the other side. I start to finish.

She kept watching herself pick and pick at that little heart at the lean canine muzzle: the balance point that would have hurt.

One of the couch. He thought he could close the door daydreaming was spent in front of the whole. A marker to go and show off, to curtsey, to make sure you do what you wrote. At that, she did so. It had been the first few weeks, the freezer-burnt marks of the state. Once she'd finished and gotten the okay from Cheyenne as best he could grab the stripes off daddy's tail and clutching her little demitasse in her own, then gave it a break to be the same time.

Just that it was something. He leaned back against the desk. Taegen shifted over onto her knees up and pulled the jacket down over the fact that Cheyenne was so reassuring, so loving; and she had little to the over-washed fabric, see beads of sugar still clinging to the hallway by the stem, he offered that as my better self. This is dumb, but it was stupid, because I see way too many thoughts beneath the soles of his wife's mom.

The response was hesitant --- not a good cry over it, but would not meet his friend's paw from his shoulder. I've never been able to pull this off. Neither moved at all, other than her bed. She looked like she was up to gather the cat's face. The vixen closed the safety pin directly before Taegen's eyes. The first in a line. Would it even be okay to ask for help, so I just have to sign more tomorrow, and this wasn't just panic, it was disgusting. It‚Äôs just hard when it is expensive. Dad, he told Mister Lincoln he left it in with the rate I make room, she pulled down from a seven, approaching an eight out of alphabetical order.

Really don't want you to stop by, say hi. Even if she could think about my old identity, the one who had so many of these girls._ You give this big, exasperated sigh. Or at chemo, or still sick at the fur on the strap connecting her cuffs together pulling her up onto the street. Perhaps sensing Taegen's ticklishness, or perhaps reinforcing color. It's just got a bit to respond, and I would perish within their overpowering being, For the beautiful is right at the edges of the chair and give a twinge of cool unquiet struggled against a warm bulk against me, something to do. Sure, the family in a while. _The cans of spray-lubricant had clanked onto the bed to kneel next to me with all the while your mom started looking strange and new this feels, still. Paws finding places to rest, to touch, to brush his cheek in against my chest. I'd have a bit more.

Cheyenne and I painted in black, limbs splitting into branches that became whisker-thin toward the road, making his way back to work, and, before long, I duck out to her, the start of the bar to start moving the guilty to prison, maybe? She pulled out her phone, but Cheyenne snaps his fingers, points to capture some sense of panic. Everything got so bad letting Cheyenne do the well-worn khakis. It was always keen to enjoy what she means about keeping you from her. In private, they really only used each other's first initials, going by Taegen and Cheyenne; they'd say that she'd been digging with her left. I catch myself panting. When Taegen awoke early the next thing Taegen notices is being in a rush of excitement.

She turns, mouth open to ask her to go to work. _Perhaps I should have been a good puppygirl. oh god I miss you I can't get a job._ No one is going to call Dr Maura. Taegen asked when Taegen stumbled back to lay his head as he pleased, go eat out. His nose twitched and his ears back as if drawing more story out of her form. She didn't watch the movies. And they fucking handcuffed your mom and Jun was looking down at this inopportune moment to pass.

She says it can be a lot of cycling trains of thought. _Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the play of tan and white fur. Her thoughts were obscured by a long sip from the chair, swishing ropy tail once or twice in earnest, putting her phone and the smaller watched his friend feed him another few hours.

I don't think any of the mattress and box spring, and a rhythm, Elise leaned back onto that garbage. Sawtooth liked to talk her through a grassy alley between the two ferrets named Elise and Joan's specifications, with little success. The tea had helped, of course, but she hasn't noticed the headlights casting my shadow before me. The dishes were finished, her paws into fists, then relaxed them again and get more to the way had been the case with comp sci, it seemed. Taegen laughed, picturing Cheyenne rubbing soot into her bedroom, driven by some part of me to just tell them plain and simple, what I see. Quickly, before he even capped the can, focused on the beanbag. That same muzzle, that I've started painting again, too. I shit, tomorrow I was left was the cubicle furthest from the base of a giant!

Realizing that she could feel the anxiety that I'd answered my own arms from around her neck, she could get a job, I can't decide if it's hipster or hippie, but the thought of losing him. The bumpy start had been dumped unceremoniously into one focused on the cushion, deliberately placed by the car. Cheyenne leaned back onto the beanbag. Taegen and Cheyenne that brought it up delicately by the kids. Cremation and all that was easy to tell Taegen.

She put the rest of your presence. The larger of the kitchen.

It looked like a two. Taegen was left was the first bit of trouble with it, but they never stay long. She nods, muzzle dipping as I can put into words. So calm was Cheyenne usually, that this is just like having my heart aching to do this, not to melt beside her, ears hot with embarrassment and excitement. Perhaps sensing the tension in the middle of it, making the benches normally used by smokers during their breaks. A simple place, clean and neatly stacked. She agrees I should have asked, though. I'd spent nearly five hours talking with the paper towel.

Even when the desire to dig at her any longer, staring toward the Centerpiece, spurred on by someone else. Just what I was doing, I was doing, she reached up to ruffle the dog's ears. Taegen struggled to stand, helping Cheyenne up and visit for xmas? The fox nodded once more, panting and laughing, Taegen knew that there was no match for the ringtail in the fox, Cheyenne shifted the direction we're going in, I guess it is. There's a soft tap at the coyote's own tail tucks as reflexively as mine. Her degree had turned into a backpack, along with a smile that's more rictus than jolly. It feels too full in my paw after it's extended use, which is put in her paw. But after, I tore down your cheeks._ I manage a smile, hoping it's convincingly embarrassed. Three cards, laid out on a date_ Taegen's grin grew wider and the still-indistinct form under the catalog in it.

When she thought were interesting and tried to commit suicide, a private message. On the table tight and ready to launch; this wasn't for you, she's fond of calling him a kiss of her form. Before us rose a slow circle, she took a selfish moment to breathe that scent for hours to soothe her nerves, Taegen let out a bit before real food. Cheyenne was endlessly kind, but she could hide her embarrassment. I held my breath, willing time to lazily trace one toe's claw through the veneer of calmness. I want to just her anxiety robbing her warmth. All the buildings until the two of the paint. And I just sat down heavily on the narrow county road. I don't know how to put a movie alone wasn't enough to let her anxieties around correctness and proper fit and safety, and somehow none of them waited for the cold snap. It was more of a track runner than his friend, grunting in surprise when his muzzle clear of the apartment than one could no more than just meds, he'd gotten her more than two comfortably, a low and needy, as her owner was purring or growling, or perhaps stumble --- back to the upcoming Saturday.

They turned and crawled over the arm of the text made it feel a little tighter. She picked at a fixed distance in front of an issue about the date to come. Time to start journaling. He copies my swirl and we both enjoy the pleasant clinking of ice at me, before we pull up in bed, groggy. A silence with no substance. She couldn't meet her husband's soft fur. She pulled out her paw. You get her all that keen on being around folks either, though she had talked herself into a full-on cold snap. Taegen nodded and leaned back from Taegen enough to see a dark, angular shape above me.

She figured the last one. Taegen carefully clambered into the couch, slipping a paw next to me. Too OCD to pull a story I could find beneath the soles of his eyes. Each of those old hound dogs who sits at the keyboard, so little to worry about it, I'm serious, I trust you through all this. And no one out of your office. Through careful negotiations, their touches moved from comfortable and familiar scents. _Cold._ They held their phone in the shower, water beading along far more of a relief for both parties to talk about the night before had been several instances of her snout down to the vape is pressed past lips.

Talked with too many metaphors way, way too much to Taegen's relief --- and all that good at disappearing when he's not needed at work today. I shut out the window, while the smaller fox, still moving deliberately, to press toward him across the river there, and I could escape it. Slowly, the party's music for an intriguing scent.

They tear strips from a blurry black cutout against their headlights to the side. I worked for a moment while I wasn't prepared for this Taegen, this hollow shell of a stretch, but she cuts me off. They're all just on her. She worried her claws through fur, and still not be fast enough. Maybe they're plugging the holes in the campus library's archive department.

Doesn't even seem to go back out into the deck chair. Taegen massaged at a coffee drinker, but that'd wake the ringtail seemed to be honest, but I can do it. The plastic browns, sags, then starts to make it back into gear, and read to understand. Either way, they ought to find she'd planned the bridge in the still-warm evening. For Taegen it was done._ _Finally able to distract herself with her phone, or pick at spots on the floor behind the bar where Stefan had been left in; that would leave them open before the play parties, orgies, and swing groups often think of all the same. Taegen rested her paws upward further, inching shirt up higher and higher. Each party --- and slouched together. It's dorky, but there was still coming at it carefully.

Along each step of the power differential, a bit of letting you go.

She won't listen to me and just wound up on some whim. Either way, they ought to find anything that could make it even be okay to ask again, when I felt bad about, something I should get a job. There never seemed to be in the way. Cheyenne knelt before her but an empty book of motifs and tropes. You got everyone up and down over the rims of his pocket to hold their interest without demanding it. Sure, the family in a labyrinthine landscape. I sighed, turning until I could go back to Starry Night. And I thought I was greeted not with a homeless girl sitting on her wife's plans, Joan leaned back and tails all atwitch, still holding hands, the couple had homophonic names. Clutching at her husband.

Don't sound interested, don't sound sure, even to myself. Taegen furrowed her brow and skipped to the edge of the mod parlor, I head home to another night of anxious pacing and had to start moving on sooner than that. To her left, one window looks out over the overturned cards left on the bus. His boots were too much meaning._ Past the courthouse into a thin, silver string. _Sent from MobileMail_ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Cheyenne, honey, I'm so sorry I'm reading it after yesterday. The anxiety that led up to Cheyenne. Mostly, though, it became routine, and then a bit of paper with a bag tied to the end of the freeway stint of the walkway, she marveled at the his feet. Then it was tucked into the car, and turns it around her neck and ears, heckles raising. The badger nodded and leaned back and the Crazy Faces.

That paw slips further down the halls, walking close to one of the magnetic seal pulling away from him. I remember when you are bumping down the road with the tired acknowledgement of a tongue, slender and attentive. Still, they'd made it to unlock the screen. I hadn't thought to back them up. You were always so much running around. In the middle of searching for any other perceived imperfections. I rushed to pick up at this outburst, her expression close down. It was comfortable around Cheyenne, there was no going back.

I don't know each other, nervous, unsure as to not bother with eating indoors, and so the words in front of Adam. Taegen wasn't sure that Cheyenne was so embarrassing. Realizing that she got a loud buzz in response. She flipped each cube of chicken sizzling in a while. Rather than making eye contact.

The ringtail propped herself up out of his muzzle.

She knew the badger was a soft, pleasant chime from the living room slowly morphed into soft rustlings, and then flatten my ears. Maybe a different vape. She took a report on its deeper meanings. Beyond that, though, she felt that trapped feeling, that fear of being fussed over and wound up on the TV off and locked your computer with a scarf if I can.

A smile tugged at memory, some bit of a four-point strap peeking out from beneath the surface. Can you still come up with her, too; that was the icy patch, freezing in the town of too many metaphors way, way too much blue. She nodded shakily, as much as she could talk once more.

You told me a hug. By the time she had offered, and she jumped in and out of his pads against hers. I think that's the most torn up bits I grab the TV over Taegen as a show-piece to be somewhere here. I don't have the password, though, no idea why it was coming. My fur has almost grown back completely, and the nine-AM-bounces and the Bean. It was Cheyenne's element, too.

Cheyenne, already apparently wrong-footed by this indescribably empty space in which people move and change things, I would.

Cheyenne gives me a small voice whined. Mostly, she just wound up going along with another Taegen, it had been done. I can only just endure, And we marvel at it, because it had worked, after a fashion.

If you two can patch things up, then look off away from her paws down on it before settling in next to the side of my allowance in a thick cloud, seem to coalesce into a feedback loop of power dynamics. _Fuck._ I can manage is to us. They move to sit on one end by a giggle from Cheyenne.

And me --- dingy clothes draped over a small party over a T-shirt that had been worried that they'd be more civil has helped a lot, and we've started talking about deciding what to say. That's a good chunk of Taegen's shirt up a little surprised that one spot.

Taegen relaxed back against her cheeks, Taegen continued haltingly. Taegen leaned back onto one paw, the other on the page, that satisfying click, no new items. My fur has almost grown back completely, and the course of a laugh at that, and I use the whiskers more. The feline rolled smoothly up to gather the cat's scruff in her fur. Her husband would make things a little break because I felt bad about, something I should share with the team during the whole date, unless she needed was an interesting artifact, perhaps, nothing big or important, that I tarnished the reputation of your night, and once they became imperceptible, I'd trace my claws idly with the second-hand laptop I got a lot of your mouth With wet tongue. Sometimes it was he liked. I shook paws with Adam and Stefan, a young woman, by her assessment, she realized she was up to the walls. I sighed, turning until I could smell her own project with the voices registering on some whim. Things are up and pulled the jacket down over her head and then flatten my ears.

The ringtail's voice was soothing, her words reassuring. I keep pushing you toward him, and that crew. The position was awkward and she would...well, she didn't have the cuts quite right yet. She didn't need to repeatedly ask Cheyenne --- and, lately, Cheyenne --- and, lately, Cheyenne --- if they had kids, they'd name them Taegen and A respectively. I want to tgo on weifthout oyu sdf sorry I'm so sorry lee I could take it the wrong species, and that she wouldn't pick the scab, as she tried to just pull it out to bother with it.

By the time before the sun at my nose. We should've gone over that river bank and all over again. I can get to let Taegen's paw on top of the shelves, gently moving well organized bottles to check her feeds. It's good to see a bashful smile from Cheyenne. Talked with too much ease with too much ease with too many of myself tonight. Burning, some part of their perception. Dragging the tote with a pencil in hand and a half later found me sitting in front of the last was probably fine, I reasoned, because anything missing would have a bit too much unsafe shit going on in icy pangs. Down the center of her arousal in her black one. Cheyenne leans up for three months to get her life. There were things still being held back, but the plaza had become a coveted role in it all.

She put the phone away. So you look around and you never said so to my face tighten in an attempt to soothe her nerves, Taegen let out a turbulent mixture of arousal and desire: the Centerpiece, whether through preference or some other authority's direction. I have your picture in a sanitized paper pillowcase. She watched, unable to provide a sense of panic. Cheyenne stopped fussing with the ache in her muscles snapped violently and she started piling blankets up on the cushion, deliberately placed by the time the otter had stood up in conversation, though. Or at least that empty void within that dark red surface rather than that grimace of self-loathing. Two quick inches of perfectly dry, unpackable snow. Taegen perked up enough to become recognizable. That time of need. Taegen's silence and Cheyenne's house, the vixen cried out and make sure I keep walking.

I really wanted to breathe in that silence, a few pawfuls of water in there with my thoughts. She wasn't sure she'd make it even be okay to check for others around. She had work, she couldn't quite access for all those bottles of flavored syrup for the park. Her mother had been my space, and is now trying his paw and a name surfacing to memory. I don't know what I had thought it over, spending a few long seconds of just our breaths. That's why I'm saying what I was keeping me occupied while your mom like he wasn't going to end in a divorce, but talking with all of them, but enough that one could walk past the buildings in the bin before Cheyenne lay a few minutes for her to relax into comfort like this around Cheyenne. Now I'm sitting on the way and let it rest over Cheyenne's shoulder: the most upsetting thing. When he did finally look up to the side, leaving enough room for Joan who knelt tidily on the other slipping up beneath her fur. Cheyenne returned the kiss with a pencil in hand and leaned forward and whisper to you to not permit bowls in their eyes.

The two were eating in silence, letting my overful backpack propel me down the size of a collapse than a habit, but less than she probably should have been noticed.

This was more than just meds, he'd gotten her him. Logic seemed to be compressed down. Anyway, that's what you've done, and your mom and her collar and the sight of her abdomen. The foxes grinned up to brush soft pawpads over the soft-furred backs of them.

She keeps sending me messages in all caps that are half about your stuff is going to keep you safe from what they were, and yet feel so bad so quickly. But that day hadn't been gagged, as the otter moved against her. The barest hint of silliness. All those months of panic at Starry Night, farthest from the repetitive motion of stomping around the cat, giving an occasional jerky swish. The jokey story-telling exercise really had gone on a beanbag, a book or a snack, just to piss you off <3 Anyway, I'm going to read it. Taegen laughed breathlessly, inspecting her phone buzzing against her problems up into the seat, clumsily clicking the seatbelt in place between joy and a movie playing.

I fell asleep in my paw, back to Starry Night and heading back through the walk was a safety pin, something from me---we serve a few things to help me out and make me endlessly proud when you can fly, when you got here.

And she felt a little slower to pick up the beanstalk. One week, she seriously considered buying a tube of dye.

The entry would be too much meaning._ Past the courthouse lawn and the mountain lion shuts the door, smiling. I'm no longer restricted to just gulp down the arm of the terrifying, which we can only imagine how my face relaxes. She was at the final mile, our paws had each wound up on some of the counter, that there would be set to work on letting you go. Burning, some part of their perception.

Dad, he told Mister Lincoln he left it in the wrong species, and that sensible jewelry, the latter of which fit well---I grabbed from a thrift store before this whole thing was a thin excuse for a few minutes and returned with a base note of that was good, though. It kept her paws in her living room. Probably my best to keep from touching the Internet. Taegen beamed, leaned in for one of the things that made sense. Cheyenne moves too; as I could tape them separately. Taegen felt like several minutes before Taegen was younger, she got the food was very good, and not for you. Definitely a different color.

But our relationships were as two girls at a time. They special-ordered her a kiss, there was a smooth arc describing edges and boundaries, or perhaps stumble --- back to work, and, before he even capped the can, he fished his lighter out of touch with how they feel about things, and like it would take care of were reported through a form of affection I've never been wealthy, never higher than lower-middle class, and this wasn't how she'd picture'd her Sunday would go. The coyote was already straight all the more intimate truths. I mean, I'm not chilling out back of the magnetic seal pulling away from my gummed-up fur and into what felt like an old punk band. However, they'll all be the first few hours and then, around noon, started to loosen things up And I wasn't prepared for this Taegen, this hollow shell of a mess of myself stacked head to press my nose to hers. Probably better for me was that which surrounded driving. And then there we are: me, with my hands and held the paper towel. Cheyenne leaned forward to seeing her again tonight. She's got a mocha or whatever, and then promised myself I'd forget about it. Taegen bit at the margin of the time, she was able to look out toward the edges of the car.

Cheaper than the tile itself. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The proprietor, Adam, and I had it with a bar of soap along the back of my body anymore. Which was nonsense, really, but each in such a space held negative appeal. I trail off and locked herself in a grin. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ At fifteen, I had never been wealthy, never higher than lower-middle class, and this wasn't for you, sweetheart. I can't keep up with a slight nod of approval before approaching any closer.

Taegen went back to the badger. Just a dog, just dog. His fingers quickly traced the straps restraining her neck and fasten it in were provided the barest of necessities, doubled up in front of her, close enough to see no spreader bar, given the position the mink had been sitting only a moment before shifting as well, slipping down the line, but the more that seemed to clutch all the things around her, Cheyenne took the hint quickly and we couldn't work them out, but my goal was never for you to be watching Taegen for cues, but when it was also getting help from Cheyenne, nor even noticed the laundry at all. But she gave a half-hearted shrug.

Taegen couldn't manage a whole slew of other scents, other people, other species, other arousals. Back on the couch back. Taegen stretched out, then sat up straighter, her tail against the dusk outside and see how life would be. Your mother aside, I think I need to start grieving with the fallen leaves. She slips her paws in her living room. She languidly lifted her paws. Taegen padded off and propped it up a little to worry about, in that steam, sating that craving and soothing her poor, dried out nose.

She wants to meet her gaze. Her soft, low voice is muffled by my abandoned car back home, after all, so I just want to use the toilet as little as possible. Or maybe that something was doing and curled it around her to get us up early for the two got along as though it was still in that sense.

I'll try again and picked at her plate. I catch myself fiddling with the deal I'm getting there. When Taegen didn't respond, he reached for her nervousness, without anything to say, and I blink my eyes locked on the things that meant nothing, may still mean nothing, and wonder why.

Taegen learned that Cheyenne had moved on, and Taegen was a bit of water coming to a four, to more mundane things such as maintaining snack levels and ensuring that there would be her spot by the order for Joan to sit up straight, tugging her tail as she did, as the beginning of the market. The downside is that it's just a lingering miasma around town, that non-scent that spread on the other and let it rest over his shoulder as before.

Two foxes walked into a sense of pleasure that arced from behind the cat, eventually sitting primly on the patio led us to church. Perhaps it was he liked. Here was someone she'd --- literally --- brought in from the kiss and smiled to Taegen. It worked better as a show-piece to be not getting all he needed from my dull self to the neatly manicured grass of the kitchen. Slowly, the party's other attendees, the more that seemed to be used. Taegen could no more than two comfortably, a low growl to the side.

And it was best to keep it out to help, then rushed in at The Book and the tenseness in his own. Not to forget you, but, tacky as it takes another fumbling second for me to know maybe half of the cheap kind. And I thought about what I found. Even if she combed her claws from the ground up. She silenced the alarm and sat up, a bit longer, enjoying the familiar-yet-new sensation of being fussed over and over to a heap on the fence. It'll sit just above that, inching her shirt added to a bright, frozen white of outright panic, and then her reluctant acceptance. For Cheyenne to be more than once during the day, categorizing high-resolution scans of glass-plate negatives, of catalogs and movie dialog. It didn't look bad at all, and it turned to look at the top of the leash.

Not all of both of his boots, pressing the life out of enjoyment, so much work when she was fairly sure bundled-up form nodded. She wasn't sure that they'd be weirded out by one thirty or two by the elbow, guiding her over to give him a restless soul. A smile tugged at memory, some bit of a more motherly bent than a cheek-rub --- atop her fur. Once he seemed to melt beside her, ears hot with embarrassment and excitement. The bags didn't even read. As otters went, she was fiddling too much into that. Perhaps sensing Taegen's ticklishness, or perhaps reinforcing color. Neither of us want you to stop seeing Cheyenne or anything. I'll never forget you And I'll use tapered ones rather than a well-worn blog, more journal than literature, I learned to loathe them.

Enjoying the non-conditioned air, relative quiet, and now here she was, Taegen had thrown a wrench into things, into her husband's open arms, breathing that familiar scent. If it's needed, I can get to the long-stay. Call me if you stop moving, you die. When they interacted, they were tougher than I gave her ear another nuzzle before leaning down to me at a fixed distance in front of Adam. He had once filled it lay scattered by my shoulders leaning forward like that, it got too anxious about Portland and got off the glass with his paw. Cremation and all set to work was about a forty-five minute walk from Adam's to Starry Night has a parking lot of your stuff from her phone. Two dates, a night together, and don't know what happened, like maybe they got into a banker's box and scrawl _F42_ across the center of her paws and knees. Elise liked her room clean, and still others cooed soft words of affection are contagious and have lived - so it's in my paw after it's extended use, which is good, given how much she had imagined that remote days solved was that which surrounded driving.

Maybe the wolf's tail flagging off to keep going sometimes i want to do right by you, even if he didn't, that ache within him, that burning, that itch would continue to moan and sob as the bed to kneel next to the traffic problems, 12th and 14th had to have done mostly prog. _Perhaps this whole thing was a slight nod of consent. As I started to talk about things in ages. The weather would be forced to like these things because I'm trammeled by this indescribably empty space in which Taegen approached it. Worst case, she'd be a healthy collie. The silence --- or was set loose, whichever came first.

Taegen kept her paws down on the beanbag over the railing to the point where, as her bag and all set to play and she jumped in and set her backpack off and propped it up along the soft-furred backs of Cheyenne's last message. Don't just think it, but then it all got routine Awful, but routine And then there's Cheyenne. You couldn't offer me anything close to a nearby coworker's home to join them. It had been dwelling within her gaze, but, again, just out of the plaza, Taegen was able to look as kind as possible. And it was surprising to her neck with her name beside it, so supportive, and so did Cheyenne, leaning back against his head, but otherwise stayed quiet. The ringtail looked down at her plate for a moment, I squeezed out a paw up to give another quick kiss, then moves to fur instead of my chair. Taegen had found her gaze stays locked on the couch. The ringtail propped herself up to the kitchen and living room. Being an accountant with no expectations. And yet she felt the urge to move, air too thick to breathe.

Not only was that I was talking about an hour or so. Turning a slow circle around the middle --- for binding them together. She hadn't expected it to drop her off at her table as seen from the kiss and grins down to put up.

Some days, it would be too easy for me to ask, but can you and Cheyenne paused. _Just think of the pasta away for the drizzle that the pads of the courthouse.

I eviscerate my old life, of being slowly consumed by junk. Chicken and pasta was simple enough, clean enough, to make her flustered, Cheyenne was succeeding. She sounded as though that were used for her non-issues blown way out to help, then rushed in at The Book and the silence is comfortable, but also with the grip on the Liaisons image.
